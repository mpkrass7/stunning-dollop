One of his credit cards alone has an interest rate of 23.99%. The balance on this particular card is 7500. We both have great jobs and recently took advantage of the housing market and purchased a home. We are able to make monthly payments on all our cards, but we are having trouble paying more than the minimum payment. One of our biggest challenges is the gasoline prices that continuously go up. My husband has been travelling 188miles per day to and from work spending approx. $140 per week on gas. This amounts to $560.00 per month sometimes more. He works as a deputy sheriff for one county, but we moved to another county(houses alot more reasonable in the county we currently live in). In order for him to work in the county we currently moved to, he would have to apply for the Sheriff's Dept. Unfortunately you can't transfer jobs between counties. In the meantime, he is living with relatives to save on gas so we can continue to pay our bills on time. He comes home on the weekends. We realize this is no way a family should live and make sacrifices especially when you have children. If approved, we will use the money to pay off our creditors and make one monthly loan payment. We know that this alone would save us alot on Interest.","debt_consolidation","personal loan","349xx","FL","20.42","1.0","12/1/1986","2.0","15.0","0.0","13.0","0.0",12573,"71.8","29.0","f","0.0","",1

Due to a rare genetic condition that I have that could be passed on to our child, my wife and I have decided to adopt.  We are very excited because my wife has three adopted sisters from Africa, and it has been a great experience.  We have great credit and a good income; however the adoption costs are around $25,000 so we would like to use a loan to spread our cash flow out a little.  We will get reimbursed for over half of this loan from my company and from our tax refunds within the next year, so there should be no problem paying the loan back.  We are just trying to not have to dip into our savings too much.  We would greatly appreciate a loan that will help us to make our dream of our first child come true.  As a young couple we really need the help in getting our family started.  My financial situation: As my profile shows, I have excellent credit.  My family owns a car dealership, so we don't have a car payment.  We only have our mortgage, a couple of college loans from my Masters degree, and we pay off our credit cards every month and only use them to get airline miles.  I have a good job as a software project manager and make over $80,000 a year.  I also have an extremely good debt to income ratio.  I have a solid history of debt repayment with no late payments ever on my mortgage or credit cards.  My profile shows one delinquency which is a mistake on my credit report that I have in dispute with an old apartment complex.  Otherwise, I have perfect credit and thus a very low credit risk.

Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.  By borrowing against my Pension I will receive the 7% interest being paid to above credit cards. I have excellent credit. I want to keep it that way.  Thank you for your consideration.","credit_card","9.09 Loan","932xx","CA","12.92","0.0","2/1/1991","4.0","","","10.0","0.0",12204,"64.6","39.0","f","0.0","",1

I've paid down the debt by about 40% over the last year and a half -- generally making payments more than once a month to each of 5 cards.  However, within the last couple of months, 3 of these credit cards have increased their interest rates criminally.  I've requested rate reductions directly and can't get any cooperation despite my very good credit history.  It feels like I'm now trying to fill a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom.  I would like to consolidate 3 of these credit cards, all of which have interest rates at 22.99% or (much) higher.  I have a stable, management position with a very good salary and remain 1000% committed to achieving credit-card debt-free life, as I have two kids to send to college soon within the next few years.  Going through the banking system and, worse yet, the ""special introductory rate"" credit card systems have only made things worse.  This solution seems to me a real solution.  I can't bear this burden on me and my family and would be very grateful for the help.","debt_consolidation","Cleaning Up My Act","015xx","MA","15.03","0.0","1/1/1982","0.0","","","10.0","0.0",44539,"59.8","31.0","f","0.0","",1

This loan is for my education, but not books or a common education, more like a street smart education and experience.  I'm practicing how to raise capital/borrow money to create profitable returns.  This is a skill I want to master to create wealth.  I'm also enjoying the experience as I don't ""need"" the money.  I don't have a mortgage, my income exceeds my expenses and I'm very meticulous about spending.  I have good control over myself mentally, spiritually and emotionally, therefore I have good control over my money. My only debt is a car lease and a interest free care credit loan for my lasik (i could have paid cash but why not get interest free financing).  My credit card balances are paid in full during their billing cycle - they are used solely to build credit and get points.  I don't have school loans as I did my undergrad as a Fulbright Scholar, and MBA's are overrated.  So I'm pretty liquid.  Even my wife's diamond ring is paid in full, and her parents paid for the wedding.   So why borrow if I have money?  Again, this is for the experience, I can comfortably afford the loan and interest, but I think this experience will make me better in business.  There is bad debt, when you buy liabilities or things that depreciate.  This is good debt, the kind that puts money in my pocket building an asset.

Three months ago I discovered the Dave Ramsey plan and have been an avid follower ever since. Right now I have a 6k in savings for emergencies. In the last three months I paid off my car and the smallest credit card. I've got 5 cards total and would like to consolidate two of the largest ones into one loan and knock out the other three individually. I forecast to be finished with paying all of my debt(besides the condo) in two years. I'm a truck driver(owner-operator) with my own paid for truck, so even these tough times don't make me hurt as much as some of my peers that have huge truck payments. My finances are listed below:  5679 - monthly income -1194 - condo pmts -740 - groceries -280 - gas for car -190 - utilities(elect, Heat, Tel) -800 - entertainment, house-hold goods, etc =2475 left for savings.  I've never known that I have so much money left over until I did my first budget. As you can see I can pay this debt off on my own, but I would rather pay the interest to people like you and me than to the banks that wouldn't let me consolidate these cards.

We have already purchased three buses that will be used in our business. The money will be mainly for shipping expenses.Below is the brief summary of the market.<br/><br/>With the ongoing urban explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an alternate industry has filled the void left by the state. Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcÌ¢åÛå_ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, Ì¢åÛåÏStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in AfricaÌ¢åÛå, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>","small_business","Urban Transportation","750xx","TX","8.04","0.0","11/1/2005","1.0","","","7.0","0.0",14729,"85.6","8.0","f","0.0","",1

They were very rude to me, after being a customer for 5 years, I was pretty put back by their attitude.    The following week, I made a $2500 payment as soon as I got my expense check.

They were rude beyond belief to me.   <br/><br/>I'm a straight up Man.  Ex military.  I work in the defense industry.

I believe it would be higher if I had a longer credit history. I am financially responsible, hold a steady income, and own my home. In the last seven months of employment since graduation, I have paid off over $6000 in student loan and credit card debt. <br/><br/>About the Loan:<br/><br/>I have been paying Sallie Mae faithfully every month for two years now and only $700 has come off the principal on my student loan of $5000. They estimate that I have another 7 years left to pay it off at their 11.8% interest rate. I would much rather have it paid off in 3 years, while paying off my credit cards as well. <br/><br/>I have four credit cards, two of which are fully paid off. They have a total limit of over $30,000. I have $6500 charged to two of them leftover from when I was in college. Both have the same high interest rates they had when I got them during school (one is around 15% and the other is about 18%).<br/><br/>With this loan, I intend to pay off the Sallie Mae remainder ($4300) and these cards ($6500) in one convenient monthly payment. Any money left over after fees will go into my savings account for emergencies.<br/> Borrower added on 11/15/10 > My Employment:<br/><br/>I am securely employed in a 2.5 year contract.

Since then I have taken on several small loans to try and build my credit, but now I am being denied due to ""pyramiding debt"" and ""too many new accounts."" Obviously by applying that has also racked up many inquiries which looks bad.    I currently own my home valued at 1.1 million and have approximately 45K in a checking account which I do not want to spend because it is our emergency fund.  Here are my debt obligations:  1) Car loan: 860 per month (48 months left) 2) Car loan: 883 per month (60 months left) 3) Home loan: 6000 per month (360 months left) 4) Line of Credit: 338 per month 5) Student loan (through my father in law): 3700 per month (only 18 months left)  As you can see there is plenty of room there for a 13K loan which which we want to use to put in a deck, fence and do landscaping work around our property.

The dealer and I are in a panic because of the following reasons -  1)  They took the old car in trade, paid off the loan, and have transferred the title and sold it.  2)  I am having a real hard time getting financing from anyone due to this economy and due to the rental property I own.  3) The title has been transferred to my name now, and as far as the state is concerned, the car is legally mine.   I am 28 years old, about to be married, already have one child, and just found out I got another one coming.  I pay ALL my bills on time, and don't have that many.  I own a 4 family rental home that has solid renters, and the rents pay my mortgage on the rental building.  I live in one of the units. Due to the mortgage I have, the banks are screaming about my debt to income ratio, which due to the rents, should not be an issue, but apparently it is.  They can't seem to understand that I don't pay for the mortgage.  I own an LLC that my rental business is operated under, I work 6 days a week at a bank call center.  My rental business is a 2 man operation, involving myself and my Dad.   My soon-to-be wife works at a call center at a bank as well, works 5 days a week.   We have no problems paying all our bills.   I am trying everything I can to make this loan issue go away and prevent it from turning into an even bigger mess than it already is.  The dealer has tried everything they can think of, and I have too, and we both have run out of ideas.  The car is a 2001 BMW X5.

It is a great honor for her and for the state of Mississippi since she is the first Mississippi theatre teacher at attend.  She is scheduled to attend her third and final summer this June.  There is a snag.  Due to a horrible mix up with her old collegiate student loans her financial aid for Summer 2008 was rescinded and she must pay right at $6000.00 in tuition before she can be registered this summer.  The original payment deadline is mid April, but Roosevelt has extended the deadline for us until early June. If she does not attend this summer, the courses she needs will not be offered again until summer 2012.   The final part of the program is a thesis production scheduled for spring 2010.  If she cannot attend this summer that production will be moved back until spring 2013.  All of the students who have begun preparation for the 2010 production will have graduated and will have lost their opportuniy to shine in this historic production.  The production is scheduled to be ""The Miracle Worker"" which chronicles the life of Helen Keller and will be an outreach to the hearing impaired community in our metropolitan area.  Thank you so much for your assistance in relation to this matter.

Currently I pay about $600 a month on various credit accounts and I determined that through a debt consolidation loan at around 11% interest for 5 years, I could pay off this debt and still be able to save half of what I am paying monthly to credit cards.   I am a single woman with a good job and own a home in Arizona. The condition of the housing market in AZ is dismal and hence I cannot obtain a home equity loan to pay this debt off. I have been working for my current employer for 4 years and feel confident that my job is secure. 8 years ago I had to declare bankruptcy due to my husband's suicide. He left me with an enormous amount of debt. However, since his passing in 1999, I have purchased 2 homes.   I am hoping that you will grant me this personal loan. None of my credit accounts (including my home) have been paid late. I have just let this debt get out of control and need to eliminate it all together.

My debt is around 8500 right now, and paying approximately 400 to 600 per month. Have a handful of credit cards which interest charges ranges from 10% to 24%.

Consolidating the loans would lower our monthly payments as well as allowing us to divert that extra money towards child care costs, and perhaps also towards building our emergency fund which we had greatly neglected for the longest time.<br/>The new plan now is to pay off unsecured debt, build up our emergency fund and hopefully still have extra cash to put into another investment while still living comfortably within our means, especially with the new addition to our family.<br/> Borrower added on 01/28/10 > To answer other potential questions:<br/><br/>Monthly bills: 1820 for mortgage, 370 for HOA, about 150 for cable/internet, 150 for a family cell phone plan, about 145 for school loans (took some additional classes for Accounting certification), about 40 to 100 for electricity (depending on the season). <br/><br/>Credit card balances/interest rates are as follows:<br/>Citi - 4,562.22 @ 14.990<br/>Amex - 2,042.24 @ 15.210<br/>Wells Fargo - 1,918.61 @ 6.65 (just want to pay this balance off already)<br/>*Have other balances on department store cards which I am paying off separately this month, totalling approximately $800.<br/><br/>I have a spouse but we chose to keep our finances (and debt) separate except for the mortgage, HOA, phone bill and property tax.

As an active duty military member, I have been deployed for 8 of the last 10 years, and found it difficult to achieve the financial security I was hoping.  While I do have college savings and a home, I would rather not tap into those secure investments to pay off my credit cards.

The easy answer would be to go to a credit counseling company, but it is my obligation to pay off my debt, which is what I will do with this structured loan.

As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.

About a year ago I  hit a low point in my life and was struggling with everything !!!!!! One of the hardest times for me which gave me the final push I needed to make a change was the fact that I ended a very serious six year relationship. I dedicated myself and everything I had to make it a successful relationship, but after looking back  I feel like I gave myself the short end of the stick for somebody elseÌ¢åÛåªs happiness. Well not ANYMORE!!!  I vowed to myself to do what  makes me happy and to live my OWN life!!!   	For me, Education and Exploring are my biggest passions!!!!  About four months ago I received the opportunity to move to MIAMI and attend FIU where I have the prospect  to study abroad in Germany!!!!  I jumped on this opportunity of a lifetime and have been saving all the money I have made  over the past four months but I'm about 2000 short of reaching my goal to pay for tuition!! I have already applied for loans and grants and have  received as much as I could from them. I need more help so that's why I came to the Lending Club! I have used this program before and IÌ¢åÛåªm currently at great standing with this program. I have never been late on a payment and I'm a trustworthy member. I know that everyone in the world is struggling and that this is not the best time to ask for help but I know with this money I will  become  happier, wiser, successful, humbled, independent, stronger, and overall an improved individual who can attend school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0,"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution","5 years","MORTGAGE","85000.0","VERIFIED - income source","n","I am seeking a loan for a kitchen remodel.  My wife and I have obtained detailed cost estimates for the project, which sum to $28,300.  At this time, we have $18,000 saved for the project, and a loan of $12,000 from the Lending Club would provide us with the difference (plus a margin of additional funds for the unexpected).  We bought our house at the end of 2005, which was just about at the peak of housing prices in our area.  We put 20% down on our house at purchase, and have a fixed rate mortgage at 6%.  Although cursory appraisals do not indicate that we are Ì¢åÛåÏupside downÌ¢åÛå with our mortgage, we have not had any success securing a traditional home equity loan though either our local credit union or a large national bank.  It appears that our situation is typical for these strange economic times: we have strong credit scores, a reasonable financing goal and steady income, but limited options for borrowing for remodeling.  Hence, we decided to turn to the Lending Club to finance this project.   My wife and I have two kids, ages 5 and 7, and we expect that our current house will be our Ì¢åÛåÏforever houseÌ¢åÛå.  We do not view our home as a short- or medium-term investment; it is simply where we want to live.  That stated, our kitchen is the weakest part of our house, and so we expect a relatively high return on this remodeling project.  Should something terrible happen and we are forced to sell our house, Lending Club lenders would share a proportionally small fraction of this risk, since our own funds will support well over half of the cost of the remodeling project.  My income is very reliable: I have a Ph.D. and a tenure-track position at a major research institution.  I have held this position for nearly six years.  My annual reviews have been very positive, and I have every indication that I will spend my career here.  In addition, over the last year I have had success with private consulting, which is the source for much of our savings.    I have been married for 11 years.  My wife is a painter, and is doing quite well on the local art scene.  Naturally, she has a day job, which is in the area of  non-profit administration. She has worked on and off in this area for over ten years, and she has held her current position for over four years.  It is a part-time situation that supports our finances but leaves her afternoons free to spend time in the studio before the kids get home from school.     As my credit report shows, we have consistently managed our finances responsibly.  The one blemish on my report is from a mortgage payment I missed a few years ago: I failed to update our automatic bill payment after our mortgage rate was adjusted (former mortgage, again our current mortgage is fixed).  If I recall correctly I underpaid by $26, but the lender was unsympathetic and reported it despite my pleadings.  Our current mortgage payment is approximately 20% of our gross income, and we pay on time, always.  We quit using credit cards about two years ago.  I have two modest car payments: $200 and $270.  The latter is for a car I bought my mother, who has been on disability since I was a teen and needs our help.   The estimated payment for the loan we are seeking will be in the vicinity of $375/month.  This is about what we paid in preschool tuition for my 5-year-old last year.  But he is going to kindergarten, and we will soon be relieved of this expenditure.  So, in effect, our monthly finances will change little when we take on this remodeling loan, and we know that we will be comfortable with this payment.  Taking the new payment into account, our monthly household debt-to-income ratio (not including mortgage) will be about 12%.

It would seem odd that with 23k a month coming in that I need a cushion.

My thought is that (and I won't break down my bills in granular format) I could use an extra 500 to 1k a month and this is a good way to get that backstop.  Importantly, there is a time horizon on these large payments as my lovely ex-wife gets her last payment in 2014.  So, I see the light at the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>Other question has been is there real estate exposure on my books or something else creating a real liability.  The answer is no.

Over time, the same thing happened with several more credit cards until I woke up one day and realized I was living beyond my means.   Fast forword a decade and things are much better. I own my car free and clear and purchased a home several years ago. I've held a steady job for many years with the same school district I graduated from long ago. Alas, the credit card debt from my youth is still around to haunt me.   I'm looking to consolidate my remaining credit card balances into one sum, with a lower APR, thus allowing me to make one payment rather than several.   I've never been late on a payment, credit card or otherwise, and I've learned the hard way about money management. Ideally I would have taken out a Home Equity loan to consolidate my debt, however the recent housing conditions and lower reappraised value of my home have not allowed me this option.   Thank you.

I lived off these cards until I found a job with a large company which I have been with for 4 years now. Because these cards were maxed it, the companies keep increasing my interest rates until it just got out of control. I am just sick of paying on them only to see most of my payment going to interest.I have tried to communicate with them, but I think because I'm never late, they won't budge.

About 5 years ago I was still moving up in the company I work for. My husband was laid off in his job with an adverstising firm. We had a lot of school loans, credit card debt, etc. When we were younger we did not make the best decisions on purchases and spending. Like a lot of young people, we had lots of credit card debt and were in over our heads. We could make payments on the credit cards when we were both working, though we were not making a lot of headway in paying them down. Then when my husband lost his job we took on more debt just to stay afloat. We missed a lot of payments. <br/>Over the last 5 years I have moved up in my job and now make around $90,000 a year. My husband makes between $55,000 and $75,000, depending on the amount of overtime he gets during the year. In the last few years my husband and I have dug ourselves out of over $80,000 in debt. <br/>All we have now is a house payment at $1,100/15 years, his truck payment $360/month 2 1/2 years remaining, and an old personal loan $157/month &ndash; matures 2014 at 8%. <br/>It has just been in this last year that we finally got to this point. Then this happens. I don&rsquo;t have the $12,000+ saved up to fix the small flood in my front yard. (I asked for $14,000 as I will have to have my walk path re-poured and don&rsquo;t know exactly how much that will cost.) I really can&rsquo;t wait another 6-8 months to save the money to get this fixed. I really need to get it fixed in the next few weeks before it gets really bad. <br/>I can&rsquo;t tell you how badly I do not want to take on this loan. I don&rsquo;t want to be back in debt but do not have a choice. We have checked with several banks and they will lend us the money, since we have such great income. But because of all of the past debt we had where we were late on our payments (when my husband had no job and I was only making around $35,000 a year) they want to loan it to us at 23-25%. If that is my only choice I will have to accept it. But, my husband encouraged me to give it a few days and try this site since the interest rate is lower. I am very nervous about getting a loan in this manner but he says &ldquo;have faith&rdquo; and see what this brings. So here I am, having faith, and asking for people to take a chance and invest in me.<br/>","home_improvement","Home Repairs","350xx","AL","2.55","1.0","12/1/1993","1.0","18.0","","10.0","0.0",203,"1.5","28.0","f","0.0","",1

My wife (Rosalie) and I were married in a house with 10 friends present.  While it was memorable- it wasn't the wedding that every girl dreams of having.  I promised my wife that one day she would get that wedding.  That time has come... the big day is jsut 3 weeks away!  We have been able to pay for almost everything, but we are finding that the last minute expenses are turning out to be a little more than we anticipated.  We are seeking some help to take the worry off our shoulders- allowing us to enjoy this moment without the stresses of money being present.  The $3000 we are seeking to borrow would be going towards the balance due to the caterer, the flowers (we are frugal and have decided to get the flowers from Costco), bridal hair and make-up, and the wedding favors for the guests.  Please know that paying this loan back would be a top priority for me.  I don't take borrowing lightly.  At this moment the time is short as the balances are due in about 10 days.  Your generousity would go a long way to helping me give my wife the wedding she deserves.  Thank you so much for considering ""lending"" your assistance.

My salon is incorporated under an independent contractor booth rental model. I have 8 stylists that pay $200 per week to work in the salon. The salon grosses $6400 per month, and the net is about $2900 per month, which is $34,800 per year after rent and utilities. I would like to add more styling stations and equipment which will help to generate more net income.  I am also employed full time for the government and my salary is $48,000 per year. I bring home about $3900 per month after payroll deductions and taxes, but this amount does vary depending on how many hours I work, and overtime, etc.  I do not have any other expenses for the salon because the stylists which are independent contractors are responsible for purchasing their own items and supplies, etc.  The only monthly debt payments I have personally totals $340, excluding housing. Including my housing it is $1,099. I do not have any credit card debt, no collections, and no bankruptcies. Conventional banks do not help people that are in my unique situation. My business is a cash business, and I have not applied for a lot of credit accounts, and the banks look down on that. I do not have a lot of open credit accounts because I do not really believe in credit cards.  I like to pay cash if I have it and that way I avoid getting into debt. I have been very responsible with credit and do not like to just open up accounts for the heck of it. Apparently this is not something that banks like, because they are saying that I do not have a lot of credit accounts. I only have 3 but that is enough for me. They want people to open up so many accounts so that you can drown in debt, but I have steered clear of that scenario. Please help me further my business venture because banks are not willing to help someone with a unique situation like me even though I have good credit scores.

1,"Pixsy Corporation","1 year","RENT","55000.0","VERIFIED - income","n","LOAN PURPOSE  This loan will be used by my business partner and I to buy an under-valued, under-nourished existing business.  BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006.

These proceeds will be used to hire the attorney and to stabilize my financial affairs.  As an additional fund-raising action, and as a risk mitigating hedge against this loan, I am also in the process of refinancing my condominium.  Its appraised value was $267,000 in 12/2006.  The target proceeds are $5,000 - $20,000.  The actual amount will depend on property appraisal.  My condo is in ""North Bethesda, MD""... approx. 4 miles North of Bethesda (an appreciating to stable market) and 6 miles South of Rockville (designated a declining market).  The need to borrow is created by timing.  I estimate that the current value of the divorce assets is approximately $200,000.  My ex-wife and I were married in the State of NC.  NC law indicates an equitable distribution should apply.  The goal is to invest up to $20,000 in hiring a competent divorce attorney to achieve the $100,000 in assets.    The assets from the divorce will be used to settle all debts.  Remaining proceeds would start a retirement fund, begin investments and be used to fund additional education. Presently I have an MBA and JD (I did pro-bono, some regulatory and in-house counsel work for startups previously, as a member of the Bar, but I do not practice law now).

American express, for example, was at 6.99% last year, and has made 2 universal increases and now stands at 15.99%, even though my credit situation has not changed and I have never been late on any payments to any lender. This is a practice which it seems is becoming more common. For example, on Amex -  http://www.credit.com/forum/posts/list/339.page#1121 http://www.creditaddict.com/archives/american-express-amex-change-in-cardmember-terms-apr-rate-increases/ http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/american-express-c142633.html  I wish to avoid the random increases and consolidate at a lower rate. Also, the 3 year term and consolidated payment make it easier for me to manage.  I have a revolving line of credit from Bank of America which has available monies to consolidate, but again at a higher rate. I want to try this site, as it appears to be more cost effective.   I am a reliable person, as I've had no late payments on any account anywhere in my credit history. I take my credit rating very seriously and am scrupulous in my management and payment of my debts. For this reason, I am a good credit risk. My credit is perfect, although I do have a relatively high debt load as a result of student loans that I used to obtain my MBA.

I&rsquo;m saving quite a bit myself, around $1000 monthly while still being able to pay for everything.  So if I receive the funds request I&rsquo;ll have no problem paying.  On the low side my net income is $2810, I say low because I&rsquo;ve factored in missing 2-3 days incase of emergencies and incase no overtime/bonus  is given, my company currently allows unlimited OT due to my position and the demand for it.  My current YTD average monthly income is $5992 or ($47,166.15 YTD as of 8/27/2010)   My bills include <br/><br/>$700 monthly to Jared&rsquo;s min payment is 435 (will be paid off by March) <br/>$400 car payment<br/>$200 Credit Card Payments <br/>$115 Car Insurance<br/>$60 Gas (I drive a Prius so this is generous allowance) <br/>$200 Cable/Internet/phone<br/><br/><br/><br/>My fianc&eacute;e who is in her last year of Law school (she graduates in May) will move here to Texas and that will increase our income as well.  We&rsquo;ve both committed to living with my parents (where I live currently) until we pay off the wedding.  The reason why I&rsquo;m able to bank the $1000 is because they do not charge me rent or make me pay for utilities or even food.  My cable bill is high because instead of going out all the time I spend it at home saving money.   I have over $40,000 in my retirement accounts so in a crunch I could always withdraw funds from them to pay back the loan.  I have been very responsible with my money but now need a little help to pay for the wedding.  My parents threw us an engagement party and our families gave us monetary gifts that totaled $5000 (which we still have and will pay for parts of the wedding), we&rsquo;ll receive at least the same in wedding gifts if not more. I choose the 5 year repayment to plan for the worst and should have no troubles paying this loan.  My credit history also reflects that I have an excellent payment history.    With this loan I would be able to pay for everything up front and not charge items to credit cards and even get discounts from wedding vendors if we pay cash.   I hope this explanation helps.<br/>","wedding","Wedding Funds","760xx","TX","19.94","0.0","5/1/1998","0.0","","","9.0","0.0",22253,"44.0","27.0","f","0.0","",1

We built it in 2007. For the first year and a half, my partners stood back and let me run it. I made over $300K with it in 2008. In early 2009, they decided to participate and it went down hill fast. To make a long story short, it went under in Nov. 2009. The landlord, our fuel supplier (Amaroil.com), evicted our company for past due fuel invoice debt. The landlord wishes to re-lease the site to me (because I made us money when I was alone) and understandably wants me to obtain my own working capital to re-enter the business.

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).

This loan will be for both consolidating my current credit card debts and also enabling me to purchase the equipment I need for my new employee. In addition it will get me through the upcoming transitional/expansion period of already having to much work to do on my own and having to train my new employee to being able to take on more jobs in the next 3-5 weeks. Thank you for considering this loan!","small_business","Web Design Business Expansion Loan","805xx","CO","10.7","0.0","9/1/2003","0.0","0.0","0.0","4.0","0.0",3534,"54.4","4.0","f","","",1

The reason I need the loan is that after our son was born my wife quit working for 7 months.

When the balances began to increase the credit card companies raised the rates considerably so I am now left with paying mostly the interest each month.

One of the cards has an approximate balance of $9500.  I closed that account, which may have hurt my credit, but I will never have anything to do with Chase or any business affiliated with them.  At least not knowingly.  In four months time, from the time they took over the account from Washington Mutual, they raised my percentage rate twice, forced me to make two payments in one month, charged me a late fee and then reduced my credit limit, which was the final straw for me. The remaining amount of the loan will be placed into my savings account as part of my emergency fund. My significant other of 11 years lost his job a year ago in a reorganization.  He was fortunate to find another job, but for less pay.  Due to the economy, there is less work and the company has cut back on hours.  Since April of this year, his paychecks cover only child support.  I believe in keeping a savings account to cover at least 3-6 months of household expenses or as an emergency fund, which I have had to tap into during the past year. Paying the monthly bills is not a problem but adding to savings has not been easy. This loan will permit me to continue to pay the bills and add to the savings.

We have prepared for over 2 years for this event and are now less than 3 weeks from opening.   Our plan is simple: Become a customer friendly, phenomenal tasting, one-stop treat shop!   We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

The owners of the business will be Bradley and Esther Appleman. Esther M Appleman is currently a certified personal trainer. Bradley is currently studying to receive his Bachelors in business management. The business will consist of 24 hour access to a gym. The gym will currently consist solely on the use of the gym and will offer Yoga and Pilates in the near future. Esther is registered to become a certified Yoga instructor mid-2009. According to City-Data.com (2009) the population of Belfair is over 6 thousand residents. Grapeview/Allyn also has a population of more than 2 thousand residents. The location, which is along highway 3 across from the Safeway store and next to the Kitsap bank, is the main thoroughfare to Bremerton for north-Mason Residents. The current facility has 72 individuals on a monthly payment plan to use the services. The only facility in the area is the one in place and has not allowed new members in several months. We will use advertising on the building, which is highly visible from the main thoroughfare of highway 3. The organization will also be referred clients from the sole local Physical therapy in Belfair, Belfair Physical therapy. Once the completion of the physical therapy is complete, Belfair Physical Therapy will recommend a membership at the establishment. We will also receive referrals from Abel Wellness, which is also located in the building to be used. 	The monthly price will be approximately $30 a month for the gym and $50 a month for access to the yoga and Pilates along with the gym. The current expected fixed cost is $5100 a month and will need approximately 170 members to break even. There are currently 72 members, therefore, only 100 more are needed to break even. 	Our Plan is for either Esther or Bradley to occupy the business during business hours and use an access control system for the after business hours. We will be purchasing much of the equipment from the current establishment. The additional equipment will depend on the number of members and will be increased as needed.

I managed to justify almost two thousand dollars in purchases during my time abroad as ""necessities"" (as in, I'll never be here again!) After coming back to the States, I had trouble making monthly payments since I had virtually no income, especially once the APR on Card #1 when from 0% up to 22%. To try and solve the problem, I opened up Card #2 and transferred the balance--but eventually charged Card #1 right back up.  So here I am, only able to afford minimum monthly payments. I no longer use either card (they are in an envelope in a filing cabinet at home) as I've FINALLY realized the evil of using the credit card. I'm at my first job out of college making less than $30,000 per year, and all I want is to get rid of this credit card debt. It seems like I'm paying hundreds of dollars monthly, but I'm never seeing the principal balances go down.   I also have a fairly large student loan to pay off, but those payments are actually much more manageable--I just feel like Card #1 and #2 have been a total drain on my bank account for the last few years. Being able to pay them both off with an $8000 loan would allow me to have a much simpler debt to control with a foreseeable END, which is the most important thing to me.

Additionally, we have been paying normal medical bills (human). We greatly appreciate your support; I am willing to offer further information if needed.<br/> Borrower added on 02/21/11 > My debt to income ratio is 4% and I currently use 13% of my credit limits (87% open credit).

I am in the extremely stable healthcare field, and they are hiring even more people of my title at the facility I work with because the demand for our services has grown exponentially in the last 3 years.<br/><br/>I plan to use the funds to consolidate remaining veterinary bills (canine - 2 surgeries, including an enterotomy with complications) from higher-rate credit cards to this low rate. I plan to pay the loan back well ahead of time, but the reason I don't pay the debt off directly from my bank account is that I would like to maintain a substantial savings for a potential car / house purchase in the next 12-18 months. Also, I believe this installment loan will continue to raise my credit score, giving me the most favorable terms on my eventual house / car loan(s). My monthly budget is approximately $1,500, as compared to an income of ~$5,000 (net).<br/><br/>After doing the math, this loan saves me slightly more money and allows me to keep a substantial savings account than continuing to pay the debt from higher-interest credit cards.<br/>","medical","Veterinary Expense","288xx","NC","3.5","0.0","3/1/1996","0.0","","109.0","10.0","1.0",2741,"11.6","18.0","f","0.0","",1

The loan will go towards the upfront capital costs of furniture, appliances, and renovation to create a wonderful caring home for the future residents.  The loan will also help with the first few monthly payments until we have all 4 patients.  Revenue for this start-up will be split among 2 sources: patient's social security payments and patient's out of pocket payments (sometimes paid for by the patient's family members).  Based on conservative financial projections, it is estimated that positive cash flow will occur starting in month 7 and the overall break-even will occur at about month 15.  We are also investing in cost-saving initiatives (efficient showerheads, washer, dryer, light bulbs, etc.) to maximize cash flow.  We hope that you will help us fund this very promising venture.

During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again. My financial situation: I have two major RACING clients one of them called me the day of my 3rd surgery, which happen to be the day before Thanksgiving. This client I have a contract for around 13K with a balance of 8K left on that contract over the next few years. I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also. The main reason as you can tell I am a trooper and never say never to a challenge. My gross income has risen 15K in 2007. I have steady monthly clients good for at least $3000. I just need that extra financial cushion to help the lives of other persons who are disabled. With my consulting knowledge of the ADA and particularly Texas Accessibility Standards which I am State certified and there are only around 600 of us certified across the vast market of the borders of Texas!","medical","Hurricane Rita Caused a Pressure Wound","770xx","TX","13.01","0.0","1/1/1998","5.0","0.0","0.0","4.0","0.0",2294,"22.9","8.0","f","0.0","",1

The company has been in business for over 20 years and is BBB (Better Business Bureau) accredited.   The seller is re-locating out of state and has agreed to owner financing at a favorable rate and favorable terms.<br/><br/>I am using my own funds for the down payment, I am asking for $14,000 from investors for the following:<br/><br/>-Advertising campaign:  The company does no advertising.  I plan to use approximately 25% of the investor supplied funds to run an initial advertising campaign in local newspapers, the internet (Google, Yahoo, and Service Magic), and direct mailing.  After the initial advertising campaign, 5% of revenue will be used for advertising.<br/><br/>-Update the companyÌ¢åÛåªs electronic equipment:  The electronic equipment the company uses can only be described as antiquated.  Paperwork that is currently presented to the prospective customer is hand written hard copy.  I will use 20% of investor supplied funds to purchase a field laptop, portable printer, and necessary software.  The impact on a prospective customer of a hand written proposal vs. a color, graphical electronic printout is well worth the cost.  <br/><br/>-Company Image:  I will use 20% of the investor supplied funds to update the company image.  The company does not have a website so a website will need to be developed and hosted.  Business cards, printed brochures, folders will need to be purchased also.  The company has no uniforms.  Uniforms for the crew and evaluator will give the company a more professional appearance.<br/><br/> The truck the company uses to haul the crew and heavy duty equipment is 14 years old.  It runs well but the appearance leaves much to be desired.  I will have the truck painted.  I will also have the company logo and contact information printed on the truck.  The company trailer will get the same treatment.<br/><br/>-Job materials: 20% of investor supplied funds will be set aside materials that will need to be purchased to complete the first job.<br/><br/>-The remaining investor supplied funds will be used for miscellaneous expenses that will arise during ownership transition such as legal fees.<br/><br/>I do not intend to fundamentally change the way the company does business.  The company has been in business for many years and has had success; they do quality work at a reasonable price.

The legal job market has been particularly difficult to break into (even the Harvard, Yale and Stanford kids are having trouble), but after nearly a year of searching, I have landed firmly in a fantastic position with seemingly endless room for growth, and a more-than-decent starting salary.  I have paid off about $5k toward my debt in the past 4 months, however a large percentage of that money went toward interest.  My average APR is somewhere near 26 percent, though I have not missed a payment in more than four years.  I am wholeheartedly committed to paying down this debt in full within the coming 36 months.  After that, I hope to become an investing member of LendingClub.  If you have any questions or would like further details, please ask!  Thank you for having faith in me.<br/> Borrower added on 05/04/10 > In an attempt to make this process as easy as possible, I have read through many current loan applications that are undergoing funding.  I've found that lenders often would like to know the names, balances, and APRs of cards that borrowers intend to pay down/pay off with the loan funds received from LendingClub.  To that end, I have placed that information below.<br/><br/>LENDER    BAL     APR      MIN PYMT   Time to Pay off@ MIN PYMT<br/>Discover $4,425 @29.99 -  minimum $134 - 18 years <br/>Chase    $5,725  @20.24 - minimum $154    28 years<br/>GM Card $10,727 @ 22.90 - minimum $311  29 years<br/>MBNA (BoA) $4,918 @26.24 minimum $153   25 years<br/><br/>The total of my minimum payments on these cards is currently $752.  I *always* pay at least this much, but sometimes more.  For example, I paid an extra $2000 toward the above-referenced Discover card in February.  In response, Discover (understandably) accepted the money and reduced my credit line by $2k.  <br/><br/>The new payment on the loan I am seeking from LendingClub would be under $900 per month.  In just THREE years, I will have paid off 95 percent of the four loans found above.  This will be accomplished simply by paying $150 per month above my current minimums!  3 Years through LendingClub vs. 20+ years through the credit card companies is a ""no-brainer"" for me.  <br/><br/>One last thing I would like to mention.  I have noticed that LendingClub members often worry that a prospective borrower will pay off the loan ahead of schedule.  At this time, it is my intention to take the full 36 month term to pay off the loan I am seeking.  If I receive substantial raises over the next two years, I might then decide to accelerate repayment.  Full Disclosure =)  Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 05/05/10 > Edited to add:  My loan payment--if granted--from LendingClub will actually only be $832/month.  This is just $80 more than my current monthly minimums as described above.  I had previously stated I would be paying $150 per month above my current monthly minimums, so this makes the LendingClub loan option even more advantageous!<br/> Borrower added on 05/07/10 > I have just submitted my pay stub and employment verification information to LendingClub Home Office.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.

My income will only get more with raises and bonuses next year.  The problem is I am plagued from bad decisions I made in College and Student Loans.  This hurts my credit score.  I am seeking a debt consolidation because my mom ran up the American Express bill (we are both on the account) and they require the account to be paid in full each month.  The balance slowly increased and I wasn't paying attention until it grew to what it is now.  Despite my income, I cannot make the lump sum payment they want.  I could easily pay it off on an installment basis, but they will not transfer the balance to an installment basis, and I cannot pay it off in one month.  The American Express is now cancelled, and my mom is no longer a signatory on any of my credit accounts.  However, I want to pay it off as quickly as possible so it does not affect my credit.  I fully expect to have this loan paid off within 12 months.  I plan to pay at least double the monthly payment each month.

I generally make more than is shown above.

I have started on John Cummuta's debt-elimination program, and have starteda small e-business, just getting started there. My goal is to consolidate to one payment, so that my 600/month is actually making a noticeable dent in the balance.  My only other debt is a car loan of $400/month and a school loan at $100/month. My rent is $700/month, and my roommates and I are hunting for a cheaper place, which isn't too easy in Boston.  My overall expenses run at about $600 for all utilities, car ins, phone, etc.   I put $400/month into an emergency savings account and may use some of that to pay this bill when I have a comfortable emergency fund established. I also have a small investment account that I'm using as a house down-payment account.<br/><br/>I'm very reliable with my bills, and am a scrupulously honest person.

I have been a faithful customer and have never once missed a payment on a debt, but high interest rates have kept them nearly impossible to pay off. I got in trouble back in college before I knew what damage credit cards could do, and haven't been able to dig my way out. I recently cut up every credit card I had; this was an amazing feeling! I have a B.A. in Psychology and am currently employed by the state of Missouri as a Youth Specialist. I work in a moderate security treatment center to help rehabilitate young men who have had some trouble with the law. I love my job and plan to stick with it as a career. I also substitute teach for the local public school system on the days that I don't work at the treatment center, which is a nice bit of additional income. I hope to get rid of my credit cards so I can buy a house before too long. My girlfriend (soon to be fiance) would like me to have control over my credit situation before we move in together, so I am hoping this will be one of the solutions! Thank you so much!

Instead, four days later, I received an email from LC stating that the loan had been denied due to incomplete paperwork. I was shocked so I contacted them and fortunately got in touch with the person who denied my loan. I asked him that how come they didn't contact me when they were unable to obtain completed paperwork from me even after I had sent them everything via emails (I have the records to prove it). Their response was that the matter will be investigated and I would be contacted within 24 hours. A few days ago, I received another email requesting the paperwork. This time I sent PDF files and also faxed the documents. I spoke to them last night and they said that I needed to re-list the loan.  They confirmed that for the re-listed loan, they have already verified all information including employment, salary, and federal tax returns and if the loan is funded again, things would go smoothly.

An SBA endorsed business plan as well as two years worth of financial projections can be provided to interested lenders.  The $9,000 loan request will be used to pay off every penny of accrued debt as well as provide Clarence and Alphie's with a small reserve (approx $1000) for working capital which will be used for vendor fees at high volume events.

Please direct any questions concerning this loan to devonadwilliams@gmail.com  My interest in using Lending Club at this stage is born out of my complete satisfaction with my first hassle-free experience with the lenders.  I have worked very hard my entire life to maintain a superb credit rating and feel that lending institutions such as large banks (whom are currently profiting off of my venture) do not deserve the business after all of the doors they seemed to close on me in my pursuit of becoming a small business owner.

He/she also asked what my delinquency was 72 months ago. It was a credit card that was paid late since I lived in a three family house and when one of the families moved they did a change of address for the family (not individually) and I so happen to have the same last name. All my mail went to another State! Obviously this was before I paid my bills online and did it the receive a statement send a check way.<br/>","home_improvement","Home Improvement to make Home Green (Energy Efficient)","117xx","NY","18.59","0.0","10/1/1998","0.0","72.0","","7.0","0.0",5571,"42.2","20.0","f","0.0","",1

I begged them to loan me the money because I knew it would help me tremendously with repaying my high intrest rate credit card debt I had accumulated through college and before landing my job after graduation. They finally agreed to finance the loan for $10,000 at 14.99%! Just below my lowest credit card APR at the time. It was disapointing to me because I have such a good credit score.

This Loan will allow us to shave approximately $300 per month from our monthly budget.  My intent with this savings is to cut back on credit card expenditures, and establish a reserve to be used to cover other unexpected expenses while repaying this loan.  The goal is to be debt free (other than mortgage and student loan) by the maturity date of this Loan.<br/> Borrower added on 08/08/11 > This loan is intended to refinance existing credit card debt.

My current job is very stable.  My current job also has much better medical insurance, which covers a greater portion of our medical expenses.

This loan is being used to pay for my son's wedding and wedding gift---he recently completed an 18-month tour in Iraq, and we couldn't be more elated and relieved that he is finally back home, safe. It will not be the most elaborate wedding, as we are staying budget conscious, but it will hopefully be a beautiful little event that they will always remember.<br/><br/>I was turned on to LC after being directed here by LendingTree. I applied in two places; a credit union, and LendingTree. I received approval from the credit union, and from both lenders that LendingTree (one being here at LC). I never knew of LC before, and after spending several hours researching exactly what it is, reading reviews, and scouring the fine print of the loan agreements/borrower membership agreement, I can't believe I didn't stumble across this earlier.<br/><br/>I decided to go with a personal loan through LC for two reasons; 1) Although I have the available credit lines on my cards, the lowest interest rate right now is around the 15 to 16 percent range, which is nearly triple the LC rate I qualified for, and 2) The entire idea of giving money back to the hardworking people who deserve it, and are kind enough to lend it to others, is just so much better than giving it to the &quot;big boys&quot; that have left me so disgusted these past few years. I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years. I am very fiscally responsible, as you can see by the &quot;A3&quot; loan grade, and I have been working in the financial sector for over 25 years. I can't think of much else to add, but I do appreciate you taking the time to read through this and sincerely hope I can get fully funded so that the interest goes back to the P2P lending network rather than the big boys on wall street.<br/><br/>Thanks again, and best regards!<br/>","other","Our little wedding!","331xx","FL","2.58","0.0","2/1/1983","0.0","","","13.0","0.0",3270,"2.4","37.0","f","0.0","",1

That being said, I'd much rather deal with this interest rate than my current CC rate (16.99%). If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to ask. I appreciate your help and look forward to being in your shoes soon. Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/10 > Lending Club, <br/>As I wait for my listing to post this evening, I thought it would be prudent to proactively answer some common questions you may have prior to deciding to fund this note.  This is obviously an investment on your end and I want to make you as comfortable as possible regarding the following items:  my compensation structure/job security, current debt obligations, monthly expenses/budget, and my regimented plan to become completely debt-free.  As I mentioned in my initial description, I plan to be in your shoes once this loan is paid back in full.<br/>&bull;	What is AmWINS Group Inc.? What is your job title and what are your duties? <br/>I work for the largest property and casualty wholesale brokerage firm in the U.S.  I have been with them for a total of 5 years (including an internship while in college) and really enjoy my job.  <br/>My current title is Producer (Broker) and I specialize in the Healthcare Industry.  I facilitate/negotiate the essential property and casualty insurance products that hospitals must purchase in order to protect themselves so they can provide us care when we need it. My career is going very well and I certainly have no intention of going anywhere.  To be honest, I&rsquo;d like to retire from here years down the road!<br/>My compensation structure is salary-based with potential for an annual bonus.  I have provided my monthly income (based on salary only) and will try to figure out how to verify that with LC today to increase your comfort level. <br/>&bull;	What debt obligations do you currently have (please provide balances, interest rates) and which debts do you intend to pay off with this loan? <br/>Mastercard - $7,000 @ 16.99%<br/>Visa - $3,000 @ 9.99%<br/>I will pay off each of these amounts in full upon this note being fully funded.  <br/>&bull;	Can you list your monthly itemized expenses and their amounts? <br/>Rent - $600 per month<br/>Car Payment - $206 per month<br/>The only other monthly expenses are utilities, groceries, gas, etc.<br/>&bull;	Monthly Budget <br/>Gross Income = $5,000 <br/>Net Income = $3,400 (after taxes, benefits costs, etc.)<br/>&bull;	My Plan (with your help!)<br/>Once I receive the $10k loan from my investor(s), I will eliminate the debt I currently have the high interest rate.  While my recent salary increase has certainly assisted me in working towards eliminating debt and building a foundation for my future, I just can&rsquo;t justify continuing to pay the interest rates associated with each CC.  My credit score and history have allowed me to work with each of you at a rate that would be unintelligent to pass up.  <br/>The monthly payment was calculated at $306.67 per month, but I will be putting $500 towards the loan amount each month.  I know this will cut the loan term a bit short and that will affect your total money earned, but you will be making a financially-sound decision.  On another note, you would really be helping me become established and allow me to look forward to the exciting next steps in my life (engagement ring, home purchase, etc.).  With a planned payment of $500 each month, I will have this completely paid off by September 2012 and then be in the position to help someone else out.

The card had nearly $40,000 on it at one point and it's down to $18,000. It is in my Grandmother's name because my dad lost a job 15 years back that ruined his credit and she offered the card to them. They have never missed a payment. It is their number 1 financial priority. They are going to continue to pay the note. My Grandmother's nerves just can't handle the card being in her name anymore so this is the solution to get it out of her name. They are as good as gold to pay it off and of course you can see that I make pretty good money with little overhead, so I would step up to make the payments if my parents can't. Thank you for your consideration. This means a lot to my family!<br/> 582167 added on 12/01/09 > Ok so I just got an email from someone asking a lot more questions.

I am educated and would find a way to live in a box and make it work if not! I keep a strict budget and was able to save over $15000 this year. My parents have been paying over $700/ month on this card for over 10 years so I don't expect them to do anything different for the next 3. I will actually be paying half of the monthy payments. I just dropped my golf membership so my financial situation is only getting better. I have enough money (over $18,000 and counting) in my retirement accounts to pay the loan off if it comes to that. If you have any more questions, please ask. I know it's hard to trust anyone these days, but all I have are words to express that I essentially guarantee you will get paid back with your due interest!<br/> 582167 added on 12/01/09 > This is site is really neat.

I worked there 3 years before the economy and my lack of wealthy contacts went dry. A friend turned me onto the job I do now which I've described above. If you guys have any more questions, please let me know.<br/> 582167 added on 12/05/09 > I just realized that I didn't actually describe my job like I said I did. I am a Drilling Fluids Engineer for Halliburton Baroid. Basically that means I am in charge of maintaining chemical properties in drilling fluid used to drill oil/gas wells. This fluid has many purposes including cooling the pipe and bit, providing hydrostatic pressure so open hole (Earth) doesn't cave in on the drill pipe we are using to drill, prevents pipe corrosion, carries earth cutting to the surface, etc. Typically, I will be in charge of one well at a time. I prepare a report every day and make recommendations to the company rep. on location. I basically spend 1/2 a year on a drilling rig, the other half at home or doing whatever I want. I want to thank everyone who has already invested and future investors. It appears this loan is going to fund. Again, you guys can sleep well. You won't be disappointed.

This is a badly needed move for us, as my husband has been unemployed for over two years now, ever since the company he was working for closed all offices and moved out of state.  After such a extended period of unemployment, and despite several major cuts in our living expenses, the savings we had two years ago have been exhausted, and although this move would mean a much more secure financial home for us and our two young children, we don't have the capital to pay for our move.<br/><br/>If this posting looks familiar, it is because it already has been posted.  There was a mistake on my credit repot that caused the credit department to remove the loan.  After discovering the error, I fixed it and we are now trying this process again.  The original request was for $7500, but since that posting, we have had money come in from an unexpected source, so we are able to drop the amount of the loan.<br/><br/>We now have the rental truck paid for along with our estimated costs for hotel, food, and gas.  What this money would be used for is the associated costs of setting up our new home.  We have an apartment reserved for us, but we need to pay a deposit on it as well as possible deposits on utility services.  We will also need to buy groceries to restock the pantry and refrigerator.  In addition, there will be approximately a 3-week gap between when my paychecks from my old job end and when my first paycheck from my new position arrives.  That last &quot;old&quot; paycheck will pay the rent for the month, but not any of the other living expenses of the month.<br/><br/>Please consider helping us with our situation!  I have never defaulted on a financial obligation in my life, even when I had to make sacrifices to fulfill my responsibilities, and you will get every penny of your money back, plus your interest.  With the new position, and the decreased rent (due to geographic factors as well as scaling down from a 3BR apartment to a 2BR apartment) we will be paying, we will have an increase in our available cash flow each month more than 5 times our loan payment.<br/>","moving","Moving for a New Job","925xx","CA","21.91","0.0","10/1/1998","0.0","75.0","","6.0","0.0",20390,"97.1","16.0","f","0.0","",1

0,"24 Hour Fitness","< 1 year","RENT","20000.0","not verified","n","My name is Chris and I live in Austin, Texas.  IÌ¢åÛåªm currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job IÌ¢åÛåªve done since last December after getting out of school.  IÌ¢åÛåªm a hard worker, and IÌ¢åÛåªm usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, IÌ¢åÛåªve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that IÌ¢åÛåªve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, IÌ¢åÛåªve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I donÌ¢åÛåªt have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that IÌ¢åÛåªm not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, IÌ¢åÛåªve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, IÌ¢åÛåªll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when IÌ¢åÛåªm asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  IÌ¢åÛåªm not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until IÌ¢åÛåªm in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, IÌ¢åÛåªm willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave RamseyÌ¢åÛåªs Financial Peace University course.  In case youÌ¢åÛåªre not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where Ì¢åÛåÏevery dollar is spent before the month begins.Ì¢åÛå  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.  Thanks for reading, and I look forward to working with you.","small_business","I just need a chance","787xx","TX","10.32","0.0","6/1/2005","1.0","","","4.0","0.0",3688,"97.1","6.0","f","0.0","",1

She had no medical insurance and Medicaid was insufficient.  Over the next couple of years, I spent over $100,000 assisting her with medical bills.  You'll be happy to know she's alive and well.  Unfortunately, at that time, I was making less than $60K a year.  After I burned through my savings, I accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in debt, most of it on credit cards (I had excellent credit then).  Needless to say, my debt level decreased my credit score by quite a lot.  After the catastrophe was over, I have continued to advance in my career and make payments on my debt.  While I'm making some progress, it's going very slowly and sometimes feels like I'll never be out of debt.  Still, over the past few years, I've greatly improved my credit by consistently paying on time and more than the minimum.  At this point, I would like to consolidate some of my debt into a simple lower rate interest installment loan rather than multiple compound interest revolving lines of credit at higher interest rates.  I'll continue to display the same tenacity in paying my debts on time, but now it will actually get me somewhere.","debt_consolidation","Consolidating CCs after medical expenses","232xx","VA","14.94","0.0","3/1/1997","0.0","","","11.0","0.0",36449,"45.1","17.0","f","0.0","",1

The reason I'm applying for the loan is because I'm moving out of the room I've been living in for the past three years.  I moved into a tiny, tiny room in Westchester County.  It was so small I didn't even have a closet.  These past few years I've learned to use the space to my advantage.  I want to move out now because I'm in a comfortable spot in my life to do so.  I found a place in the Bronx that isn't exactly above my pay grade but one where it would leave me a bit underfunded given my bills.  Between the apartment fees, utilities, medical bills, and other monthly bills I don't feel with the loan I have I'll be able to live decently.  So I need the loan.  I have a very good job at CBS Radio, but I don't make as much as I want.<br/> Borrower added on 04/21/10 > I plan on using the funds for several reasons primarily for moving out.  The initial apartment fees are roughly $4000 dollars which includes the first month, last month, security deposit and broker fee.  After writing out a careful budget of all my essential bills (i.e. rent, electric, phone, transportation, food, medical) I realized I wouldn't be able to live decently.  I needed help.  So I am turning to get some help. <br/>I'm also using the loan to consolidate the remaining amount of my credit cards, which stands at $3700 dollars.  The remaining amount will be added to my account to help pay for my rent and other essential costs.  I want to mention that I am an extremely hardworking guy who constantly monitors his credit score.  I currently hold an average score of 750. I always pay my bills, pay more than the minimum, and keep an eye on what I spend.<br/> Borrower added on 04/26/10 > Living on my own has been a goal of mine for some time now.  I suppose part of the reason was I was tired of sharing bathrooms, listening to loud music at inappropriate times, constantly eating out and living in a room without a closet I think it's time to pack up and move.  Life has this way of telling you when to hold them and fold them and I think it's time to fold and live on my own.

I have about $10,000 in 8-4%APR credit card debt that is fixed...the rest will be paid off with this loan and cash by years end.

Unfortunately, $5000, even $3000 is a hard number to have lying around.  So I am looking for a medium term loan to cover this cost.  Thanks!

To make a long story short. My bank deposited to much money in my account over six months ago. I had received a settlement from an Asbestos Claim. My son deposited the check and when I looked at my account I thought it was indeed all mine until I received a phone call at work telling me I was overpaid by $50,000. Needless to say I was shocked, I have paid all the money back except $8000. The problem is that I do not have much time before they close my account and issue a chardge back. I am trying to avoid this and save my credit among everything else. The bank has alloted me extra time due to the fact that I have made a sincere effort in resolving this issue. I am due another check from a claim, but will not receive that until February and the bank will not wait that long. Please rest assure that I plan to pay back every penny no matter what I have to do.

0,"Deloitte and Touche","< 1 year","RENT","48000.0","not verified","n","Hello Everyone!  LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in ""context"" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollar‰Ûªs ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read‰Û_ well I won‰Ûªt digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base.

Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.<br/><br/>Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner. My formal education background is a Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a concentration in Entrepreneurship from the University of Alabama. I have years of experience in management, retail, and customer service.<br/>","small_business","Small Business","365xx","AL","0.0","0.0","9/1/2002","3.0","","","3.0","0.0",0,"0.0","14.0","f","0.0","",1

I have already saved $5,000 in an attempt to meet the SBA requirements of 20% collateral of the SBA. However, not many banks are willing to lend to a business where the main source of revenue is the sale of tobacco, even more a startup.  We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.  Our goal is to soft-open on August 28th with a grand-opening on September 19th, 2009.

Not that I expect this, but even a worst case scenario would have me easily cancel some non-essential expense, such as my long term disability for example (I am actually over-insured with 2 LTD policies), which at once would make up 2/3rds of the monthly payment.<br/>Add to that how I overpay on the mortgage each month, as well as on the car loans, and you see that I have some flexibility built into my finances as it is. <br/>Also please note that there is a third car loan my credit report which is actually a co-signature on a friend&rsquo;s loan, and I do not make any payments on that. But just as it is the spirit of the Lending Club, we helped a person in need when the bank wouldn&rsquo;t. Our friend has been dutifully paying off the loan for several years, just like you can expect from me.<br/>Thank you for considering my application and please feel free to ask should you have any more questions.<br/>","other","Cash Flow insurance","194xx","PA","22.45","0.0","12/1/1999","1.0","","","6.0","0.0",12657,"68.4","19.0","f","0.0","",1

Unfortunately I had to use my credit cards about 5 years ago when I was laid off by my previous employer who told me it was temporary and to just wait a week. That week turned into 4 months before I realized my cards were getting maxed out and took a different job. Since then I have not made as much progress paying down my debt as I would like. While I have made some progress, it's not enough, I want to be debt free in 5 years.<br><br>  I recently purchased a house and rent out several of the rooms to help with my income. I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).<br><br>  My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:<br> Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)<br> Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)<br> Citi: $2100 (29.99%)<br> Sears: $2300 (28.99%)<br> Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)<br> Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)<br> Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)<br> HSBC: 300 (29.99%)<br><br>  I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address. I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.<br><br>  If you have any questions, please let me know. Borrower added on 06/21/11 > I would like to add that my FICO score is quite low, but only because I recently changed from a big bank to a small credit union.  I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.  My other LendingClub account before this was rated MUCH more favorably (it was a B or C score I think?) and nothing has changed much in terms of my overall credit standing.<br/>","credit_card","Credit card consolidation loan","201xx","VA","17.78","0.0","10/1/1996","2.0","","99.0","15.0","1.0",17419,"57.9","37.0","f","0.0","",1

My debt started to jump as soon as I had to move out of my ex's house. Even though my apartment rent isn't that huge, once you start buying groceries and paying bills, you get backed up, especially if you don't have the money to begin with. I have just gotten to a point where I pay so much on many little bills that keeping up is getting impossible. I needed a way to get all my bills into one without screwing up my credit like most consolidation loans do. I have about 11,000 in credit card debt, 5-6,000 in student loans, 3,000 in medical bills, and a 12,000 car loan. 18,000 was the highest I could get so whatever I can pay off will help tremendously. Obviously I need to pay my credit card debt because the interest rates are high, even higher than 16%. After that, I need to put the rest towards my other bills. I feel like such a failure, I am an educated woman with a masters degree and the fact that I could get myself into this much trouble makes me sick. I barely sleep at night thinking about how I can help myself get out of this. <br/><br/>Any help would be appreciated more than you know.

I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000.

I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>","other","Carlos Loan","760xx","TX","12.37","0.0","4/1/2007","0.0","","","10.0","0.0",6547,"57.4","12.0","f","0.0","",1

0,"","1 year","MORTGAGE","53500.0","VERIFIED - income","n","I have a complex and somewhat unique situation for which I am seeking a loan.  This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.  My sister is determined to keep her career which she has worked so hard to build and I am doing what I can to help her.  I would deeply appreciate an understanding of the unfortunate circumstances of the situation and any willingness to help.","other","Liability for 3rd party IRS debt","984xx","WA","10.56","0.0","10/1/1991","1.0","","","6.0","0.0",25121,"88.4","12.0","f","0.0","",1

I'm currently an associate at a middle market investment bank making $75,000 per year. I'm looking to obtain a loan to obtain some breathing room and pay off my remaining car loan thereby obtaining the title to sell. Once sold, I plan on leasing an affordable vehicle with a warranty. My current 2002 vehicle is out of warranty and is starting to fall apart, this has the possiblity to become very costly. I'm also looking to pay off my AMEX balance of $3,000. So in essence, trying to obtain money for a debt swap thereby ridding my high interest AMEX debt and ridding myself of my current vehicle liability. I'm fortunate enough to be in a position whereby I receive a bonus each time a deal closes, until such time when that occurs, this is my plan.

I would like to furnish my apartment, but i can not get a loan because my credit score is too low.  I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.    I would like to request a loan in the amount of $15,000.  I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.  I am interested in applying for the loan.    Thank you.

I am working with a broker and found a really nice diner in a very nice area. It is a well established restaurant earning $6,000/week for breakfast and lunch with the potential for monetary growth. Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd. The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food. This restaurant has a successful operation records and the place was established in 1986. The area is surrounded by really nice houses, many offices, a mall, and plenty of parking. I drove around and this is definitely a wealthy neighborhood and people can afford to eat out on a regular basis at a restaurant like this one.  Facilities: 2050 SF plus a full basement. The restaurant cans seats 65 in the dining room.   About me:  I graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York (www.hws.edu) with a major in Economics and a minor in International Relations.  My educational background, personal experience and career interests has equipped me with the tools to run this business. It has always been my dream to own and run a business and this is a great starter place. I am confident that I can successfully bring this business to the next level. I am currently working as Legal Assistant at a large Financial Company. I am quite accomplished in dealing with a diverse group of individuals from a wide array of backgrounds.  My current salary can cover the loan in case the restaurant does not produce what I am projecting.

I am forever grateful. - Jamie<br/> Borrower added on 07/23/10 > I just saw these other little questions. <br/><br/>How do I plan to use the funds? I have credit cards and medical bills that I need to consolidate into one loan and somewhat lower interest rate in order to comfortably be able to pay and meet every loans expectations. I want to honor the debit AND to pay it off as quickly as possible. I have had folks tell me to not pay the hospital and for me frankly that is not honorable or morally right. So I am looking for solutions to pay comfortably and to pay fully.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower? I am dedicated to honesty and doing the right thing. I do not ever give up no matter the challenges I face. I will succeed. I will continue to live and I will be healthly both physically and with my resources.<br/><br/>My monthly budget? I have about 5 credit cards and two bank loans and one large loan to the hospital. I have the obvious mortgage, auto loan and insurance, household mthly (electric, gas, water, etc). I make a good income and would simply like to be less strapped at the end of paying all my bills and feel like its ok to go to a movie every so often AND get popcorn. Main goal is to consolidate and lower interest rates. Willing to be loans in full just would like to lower the overall interest rates.<br/><br/>How stable is my job? Totally. I am very well respected in my profession and in my company. They saught me out after hearing about my cancer and have supported me as if I were family thorughout the entire process. My previous job I was at for 18+ years and there to held a high position. That job was extremely stressful in location as well as duties since I worked a contract for the Department of Defense in Homeland Security. So I needed to make healthier choices and IMS heard I was looking and picked me up right away. I feel I will be at IMS forever, no doubt, well ok, until I retire.

I'd rather not go to a bank for the money as I believe in P2P lending.  I have a Prosper account with and active debt consolidation loan that is over half paid off.  I also lend a small amount, but that system has gone into a Quiet Period just as I had hoped to take out this loan.  The good and the bad is that It's caused me to look a alternatives and here I am.  This loan has two purposes, but the primary function will be home improvement. I just purchased a house and I would like to make a few improvements. I really don‰Ûªt want to deal with a bank for this money and having invested a few hundred dollars into Prosper, this is the place and you are the people that I would like to have benefit.  My secondary purpose for this loan is to pay off a balance owed to a dentist.  Loan Detail: Home Improvement: $6,000 Dentist: $1,500  Total $6,500  I am currently paying $240-$300 a month to the dentist. Re-directing those payments alone should cover the payments on this loan.

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: <br/>1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years <br/>2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) <br/>3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom <br/>4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.   Thanks!","major_purchase","Vineyard Property in NZ - Perfect Timing","117xx","NY","4.73","0.0","3/1/1992","2.0","","","5.0","0.0",0,"0.0","30.0","f","0.0","",1

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve CornellÌ¢åÛåªs alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wifeÌ¢åÛåªs part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means. We donÌ¢åÛåªt own boats, motorcycles, SUVs, pool, big-screen TV, or other frivolous depreciating assets.  My volvo 10 years old, my wifeÌ¢åÛåªs is 8 years old; both paid for and running great!  We are working to pay down debt - our mortgage is conventional and we pay towards principal on all other debts each month.  Please contact me if you have any questions, and thank you for considering this request. God Speed!

The income listed in not household but individual. This credit card has been paid off slowly from 22k to 7780 in a year and a half. The problem is everytime I make a huge payment, the credit card company lowers the credit limit to whatever I paid. For instance I made a 10k payment. Then they lowered the limit 10k. This affects my credit score and debt to ratio. I have never been late on a payment.  The credit card company claims that they have been affected by the economy and those whom filed chapter 13/7. So they are lowering credit limits to off set their loss. It's upsetting. I worked hard to have my credit score be in the excellent range, I never asked for a credit increase. They increased it, and when I used it with the intention to pay off in 2 years. They are now lowering it as I pay off, which affects me. I will cancel this card if my loan is funded.

The financing will help me to quickly get this home up to a standard where we can enjoy it.  The term sought is 5 years or more.  As you know, traditional real estate financing is difficult.  In this case the acquisition debt plus this debt will at the end result total less then 80% of the home's market value.  Problem is, the banks won't currently lend based on anticipated value but only on 80% of the current value which is depressed due to the old kitchen and no deck.   My credit is outstanding.  I have never missed a payment on anything. I have never been unemployed.  I have graduate degrees in both engineering and business so my employment risk is very low.

On the day this loan request was created (5/24) and as my screen name suggests, my FICO Score with TransUnion was 715.  My timely payments in excess of the minimum due each month have not been enough to keep my interest rates at a reasonable level.  While I have been consistently on time with my payments to Citibank, my interest rate has risen to 29.990%.  The majority of my monthly payments (approximately 80%) are now absorbed by high finance charges rather than paying off my actual balance.<br/><br/>I am a successful district manager for Limited Brands' Bath & Body Works division.  More than 1600 stores in the United States and we are expanding into Canada and have a few overseas locations.  I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.  I want to add an additional note to alleviate any potential concerns investors may have about my ability to repay the loan here on Lending Club.<br/><br/>In the unlikely event that I found myself unemployed and without a steady stream of income, I would borrow against my 401k retirement account to pay back my loan here on Lending Club.  As of today (5-28) I have $90,000 between my 401k/savings retirement account.  <br/><br/>Thanks again for considering me as your next investment.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Goodbye High Interest Credit Cards!!!","015xx","MA","7.78","2.0","11/1/1989","0.0","15.0","","10.0","0.0",20270,"48.7","15.0","f","0.0","",1

I make enough in my current job that I can certainly afford loan payments, but would have to wait quite a while to save up enough to pay for my educational expenses up front. In the current economy, only the wealthy and the destitute(the only ones who qualify for much financial aid) can afford to go to school using the more traditional payment types. Because I make enough to live on, I don't have the opportunity to better myself without seeking a loan.   My credit history and score are reasonably good, and hopefully will be improving more in the coming years. I always make payments on time, and usually pay more than the minimum, because I don't really like being in debt. Also, the job info. on this site won't really give a good idea of how much I actually make. I recently (January of this year) got a job with the state of CT. In order to accomodate the schedule for it, I dropped myself down to on-call status with my other employer Sunrise Northeast, for whom I've worked for over 5 years. I take extra hours as a I please with both jobs, and therefore make 2-3 times my base pay, which is only about 1200 per month, pretax. Since I am able to take on more time, within certain limits of course, I can work more to pay for extras such as vacation, without sacrificing paying my bills. I believe that I am a good candidate because of the aforementioned, and hope that you will view me as such.

I have only been late once on a bill to my credit card in 10 years and it was only because I posted it two days before the due date and forgot the due date was on a Sunday. I generally post my payments one to two weeks before the due date.  I made the mistake 3 years ago to do a cash transfer, thinking it transferred with the same interest rate of fixed interest rate of 9.9 %, and to my horror the interest was over 21%. My step-son was moving to our area to live with us, and I needed to come up with rent and deposit quickly since we lived in a small place at the time. I transferred $3000.00. I have talked to B of A numerous times to try to lower that interest rate because of course they pay off the lower interest rates first so the higher interest rate part keeps climbing. I think you will find that I have excellent credit and hope to find a more reasonable rate for my debt. We very rarely use our credit card and only used it recently for a car repair of $1000.00 I applied for a different card recently to see if it would cover the cost, but am reluctant to use it and it doesn't cover enough to take care of the higher interest portion.

I run an Internet marketing company and I am seeking funds to help launch my latest and greatest project, a Chicago community website.  Funds will mostly be used for web development work and initial marketing expenses.  The website will make money from network sponsorships. Due to our already established local connections we already have many paying clients lined up waiting for the website to launch. These payments will be significantly higher then our monthly loan repayment which will allow us to pay the loan off early.  We estimate the loan will be paid off in full in 12-16 months. We consider this a safe loan because even if the business is a complete flop (not likely!) I have an existing income stream from other websites that will more then cover the payments with no hassle. Payments will be automatic and always on time. I am also investing a great deal of my own cash into this project, so I have complete faith in the business.

I spent the winter restoring the interior and all it needs now is this engine rebuild.   Having the engine overhauled boosts the airplanes value from it's current $20k market value to around $30-$32k and makes it more fuel efficient and reliable.  Once the airplane is flying again, I plan of flying it for various charitable missions, including Angel Flight, Young Eagles and Pilots n Paws (animal rescue). Flying is my passion and I like to apply this passion in a way that I can help others!  I recently relocated back to MA, am college degreed with 20+ years career experience. I recently accepted a new job in the medical device industry, and have a decent income ($90k/year) going forward, but living expenses while out of work, plus necessary move costs incurred to get myself here have depleted my current cash reserves.  Based on my new job income ($7500/mo) , I will be in a position to pay off my current credit cards and service this loan without any difficulty, in fact, if they provided shorter terms, I'd gladly pay off in  just 4 months. but am OK with carrying this loan out to it's 36 month (3 year) term. Longer term, I am looking to eventually buy real estate (condo or starter house)    Time is of the essence! The engine rebuilders in PA already have the airplane engine in their shop now and I need these funds to get the 4 week remanufacturing cycle started. They need $6k down and the balance upon delivery. I will have the funds (through future pay checks) to cover the aircraft mechanics fees to reinstall engine when it's done.     I really appreciate your consideration as a potential lender!","major_purchase","My Cessna Airplane Needs Engine Overhaul","018xx","MA","12.72","2.0","1/1/1995","0.0","3.0","","15.0","0.0",11265,"39.0","29.0","f","0.0","",1

It has worsened to a point that my eyes can no longer be fitted with glasses or contacs.  my only option is to have a corneal cross-linking done to stabilize the cornea, then either a lens implant or lens transplant to allow my eyes to be fitted properly.  If I do not have the procedure, then I am faced with the inconvenience of not being able to see clearly and place my career of choice for over 20 years on the line.  As a teacher, I am continuously transitioning from close vision to far away and the keratakonis keeps me from having that clarity. <br/>Unfortunately, this medical procedure is quite expensive and not covered by insurance.  Also, due to my home location, travel and lodging for re-coup time and follow up appointments almost double the cost of the operation.  I do not have that kind of expendable cash, thus am asking for assistance.  Any money received that is not needed for my surgery will be used to pay other eye doctor appointment costs that were out-of-pocket for consultation, etc. <br/>Thank you so much for any  and all assistance you can provide.  I am a good risk, pay my bills on time and have secure employment with tenure.  Have a wonderful day!  strandisa  :)<br/> Borrower added on 04/10/10 > I would like to add that I also pick up extra jobs that I use to supplement general daily living expenses and at times I have needed to put that money towards bills if I happened to have a short month.  I tutor students privately outside of school for $40 dollars per hour, rent out a room when short-term visitors come to Nome on a special occasion or assignment, and I did have a roommate for three years, but she recently moved out, thus the main reason why my debt increased.  I just wanted to point out that although the budget I submitted appears very tight on paper, there are always options for me to utilize in helping financially, thus there's actually a god amount of ""wiggle"" room.  thank you!!  Have a super day!!  strandisa33  : )<br/> Borrower added on 04/14/10 > Dear investors...thank you soooo much for your contribution to making my loan successful.  I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a ""pay it forward"" philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.  Anyway...I have no words that go deep enough to express how much I appreciate your generosity.  I promise you that you will not be sorry and will be paid in full as soon as I am able.  God bless you!!  Fondly,  Susan  ;)<br/>null","medical","non-covered medical surgery","997xx","AK","15.31","0.0","2/1/1997","0.0","27.0","","7.0","0.0",12424,"80.4","24.0","f","0.0","",1

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.   I have a base salary of $35,000 from the facility that I am based out of and had commissions paid in the amount of $6600 in January and $9000 in February. My gross income for 2007 was $85,000 with a base salary of $20,000 and commissions of $65,000 for the year.   If you notice on my credit report, I have not missed a payment on any debt. I wish to keep it that way and am looking for a loan to consolidate some of the monthly payments and reduce the total amount of my long-term debt.

The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal ""you give me money, I say thanks and make payments"" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctor‰Ûªs bills and auto repairs from last year. All of that is now resolved and we are paying everything down, and I‰Ûªve never missed a payment on anything.","educational","Adopt a math student!","294xx","SC","29.6","0.0","9/1/2003","1.0","0.0","0.0","6.0","0.0",3043,"58.5","6.0","f","0.0","",1

Prior to turning 17 I worked part time from the age of 13.  I held my first real job at a Market Research firm for 10 years.  I worked my way up from telemarketer to Marketing Director eventually landing in Honolulu HI running a branch office.  When that office closed, I went to work for Nextel Communications and was a Customer Relations Manager for about 2 years before moving to CA.  Since living in CA I have had 2 jobs, the first as Operations Manager for an IT Outsourcing company (2 years) and most recently as a Data Analyst with a Telecom Expense Management firm where I have been employed for the past 2.5 years.  There are no gaps in my employment history and I have never been without a job.   I currently have 8 debtors, which includes 7 credit cards at decent interest rates and a small line of credit for overdraft protection.  I have paid off a home mortgage, and 6-8 auto loans with no late payments or fees.  I have never bounced a check, missed a payment, or had any liens against me.  The only issue with my credit report is the credit cards for which I am seeking this loan to pay off, all of which are up to date and in good standing.  My take home pay is about $3K a month.  I have monthly expenses of about $1815($800 rent, $200 car payment, $65 insurance, $150 utilities, currently paying $600+ on credit cards).  My goal is to pay off my credit cards and close all but one of them with this loan.  The remaining credit card I plan on making $150 payments on until paid off.  I would like to purchase another home in 4-5 years once this debt is paid up.  I do have access to family funds and a second income from my partner in the event of any emergencies.  I also have $6K in savings to fall back on.  I am very proud of my credit and payment history and would never do anything to damage my credit.  The majority of this credit card debt was accrued 10+ years ago and I am currently living well within my means.  My problem is that since I have such a large amount of credit card debt banks will not issue me a consolidation loan despite my flawless payment history.  If you invest in me I will not let you down.  If you have any additional questions or concerns please ask away.

At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us. And that is why I am here, so that our company will continue to realize the success which it has had for 25 years.    Please feel free to ask any questions. I will gladly provide any additional details you may require.    Thank you for your consideration.  Borrower added on 05/13/10 > We have recently incorporated a new division of our company in Nevada, to take advantage of the better tax structure, and to be closer to our clients.  This will save us thousands of dollars each year on taxes, and help expand the business. The current business climate is also improving, as the economy and world markets stabilize. All of this is good news for us -- as long as we have capital to take advantage of our growth opportunities. This is the main reason for contacting Lending Club, and seeking this short-term loan.<br/> Borrower added on 05/22/10 > I was recently notified by my Credit Keeper account that as of May 18, 2010, my FICO score is at 750. I thought that members of the Lending Club, who may be interested in investing in this current loan, would like to know that. I hope this demonstrates that even under adverse conditions I am able to keep my business and personal accounts in good order, and that I always maintain my obligations in a timely manner. <br/><br/>Our company has been in business for a long time, and throughout the current economic climate -- and the credit crunch that has made business advancement difficult -- we have still maintained all activities in a professional manner. We are able to continue, and to advance, and -- with the support of the members of the Lending Club -- we will prevail. Thank you for being a part of our future.<br/> Borrower added on 05/24/10 > Here is some additional information about our company, and the work we do.<br/><br/>We are in the marketing research and consulting business. Our main task is to speak with customers, and ask them about their experiences. We ask them what they like, what they don't like -- and why. There are many different aspects to this marketing research, but in a nutshell we provide direct-from-the-customer data, and opinions, which our clients then use to improve service. <br/><br/>As the economy is improving, new areas of potential business are opening in many parts of the US, which also means that our clients are stepping up their marketing research activities. This is good for our business as we seek these opportunities, and continue to build upon them.<br/>","small_business","Helping to Bridge a Credit Crunch","900xx","CA","24.45","0.0","5/1/1990","0.0","","","18.0","0.0",18252,"77.0","34.0","f","0.0","",1

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities. Borrower added on 06/19/11 > I just want to thank all those that have contributed toward my loan and those that will in the coming days. Initially I saw this site as a unique way to secure funds to pay off debt without having to deal with a bank. However, as I watched my loan money increase through individuals' investments, I began to feel a strong sense of accountability to this community of lenders and borrowers. Because I work in social justice and community revitalization, I connect personally with the concept behind Lending Club. I hope others that use this site have an equal level of respect for those that have chosen to funnel their own earnings into someone's loan request. Failure to do so would amount to a shameful act of failing the community as a whole. Ventures such as this only thrive and grow as people commit to the principles and values backing it and see to it that they meet their obligations.

The appraisal came in at $220,000.00 during the refinance while Zillow estimates the property at $213,000.00. I currently owe $175,000.00 on the house and there is no second mortgage or HELOC associated with the house, only the first mortgage. When refinancing, I made a large payment at closing in order to reduce the amount owed to just under 80%, thus avoiding PMI. However, this payment wiped out most of the savings that would have been used to finance the wedding.<br/><br/>Debts<br/>=====<br/>I do have two credit cards whose balances have risen recently due to some of the initial wedding expenses. They are both American Express cards. One is at $3400 while the other is at $2500. The rates on these two cards are both at 13.24%. The first $5900 from this loan will go directly to paying off these two cards.<br/><br/>Budgeting<br/>=========<br/>I follow a 60 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 budgeting scheme and use Mint to manage my finances. 10% to retirement, 10% to long term savings, 10% to short term savings, 10% to fun, and the rest, 60%, to cost of living (mortgage, lending club loan payment, bills, clothes, gas, etc.). Each of the first three 10% amounts are auto-drafted on pay day. This leaves my budget roughly as outlined below:<br/><br/>$4820 : Net Monthly Income<br/>-------------- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 --------------<br/>$500 : Retirement<br/>$500 : Long Term Savings<br/>$500 : Short Term Savings<br/>$500 : Fun<br/>---------------------- 60 ---------------------<br/>$1250 : Mortgage<br/>$130 : Mobile Phone (Family Plan)<br/>$100 : Power (average over last 3 bills)<br/>$30 : Gas (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$22 : Garbage (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$36 : Lawn<br/>$16 : Water (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$400 : Groceries (rounded average over last 3 months)<br/>=====================================================<br/>$836<br/><br/>The 60% can obviously fluctuate, but with the savings already factored in, there should be plenty of wiggle room. In addition, I have not adjusted my tax withdrawals, which left me with a more than $3000 return this past year. I intend on reducing my withholdings, which would increase my montly income beyond what is listed here.<br/><br/>Intentions<br/>==========<br/>The three year term on this loan is seen as a worst case to me. I plan, and hope, to have the loan paid off in 2 - 2.5 years.<br/>","wedding","Lender Getting Married","300xx","GA","3.01","0.0","6/1/1995","3.0","38.0","","9.0","0.0",7114,"16.5","19.0","f","0.0","",1

I have a research program that is actively funded by the National Institutes of Health.  What is important about these two points is that I have job stability and a steady, strong source of income.  I am never late on bills, which include student loans, a mortgage, car payment, and credit cards and personal loans.  I am looking to actively pay down debt over the next several years, starting with two accounts.  One is a credit card through Chase that was through Washington Mutual.  When the card transferred to Chase, the interest rate climbed from 10% to 29.99%.  Again, while I have never been late on a payment and continue to make the monthly minimum, I will be unable to pay down the debt (which now stands at just under $3,000) as quickly as I would like and desire a lower rate, something they cannot give to me for 12 months.   Also, a promotional purchase (centrail air installation and furnace work) on a Home Depot card is about to expire, and with it about a $1,000 of interest will be added to the principal amount (now just under $4000) of the loan.  This, combined with the high interest rate (26.99%, which also increased earlier this summer), will make it difficult for me to pay down the debt.  These two accounts are the two primary roadblocks to my plan to decrease my non-mortgage and student loan-related debts.    While my salary provides me with a reasonable debt-to-income ratio, it might sound strange that I underestimated the financial impact of my son following his birth in March of last year.  He began daycare last November, and the $200 weekly daycare payment has made disposable income at a premium, and my desire to make well more than the monthly minimums difficult.    I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and look forward to hearing from you.

I have smaller bills Macys ($201), Avenue ($489) and Ann Taylor Loft ($168) which are being paid off within December and January which I will get extra paychecks due to bonus and 5 week pay month.  I moved this past summer to a lower income apt. 3 floor townhomes in a revitalized area (very lucky deal for me) and needed to make major purchases with Raymour and Flannigan living and dining room set 0% finance until 2013 ($3308) and I purchased a washer/dryer at PC Richards 0% 18 months ($1602) so...these are being paid monthly and more than the minimum so that I meet the no finance fee deadlines.  I wanted to explain the total outstanding credit and how I planned to resolve it.   <br/><br/>Once the finances are better I can plan for my training and increase my salary by next year this time I should be in a better place and I can plan for my wedding.  I refuse to burden my partner with my debt obligations and I want to clear up every thing ASAP. <br/>I remain ever so grateful for your kindness and consideration.<br/> 578890 added on 11/25/09 > Here is a change you can believe in... I had 47 cards at one time and I decided to do some major overhaulin...I paid them in full, never late and I demanded to close most of them so currently I have 17 soon to be 11 when my bonus comes in and with your help I will be left with only my 0% financing furniture purchases and Lending club loan... HOPE IS ALIVE!!!<br/> 578890 added on 11/27/09 > My budget with lendingclub loan would be as follows:<br/>Rent $450, food/travel $300 gas/electric $60, internet service/phone $60, lending club $441.00, credit cards is $400 Juniper/Amex for 6 months then these will be paid off, $100 for 0% financed apt furnishings= $1811. I take in $2000.00 without overtime so this will leave me $189 BUT in December I will get a raise $300-$400 sooo I am looking at $489 to $589.  In 6 months when Juniper/Amex is paid off I will have $400 sooo then I will have $889 to $989 part of this can go towards the 0% financed furniture bill.  I am paid weekly and there are (5) months in a year I get 5 paychecks plus bonus @ Xmas time sooo this money I save towards clothing, doctor/dental visits, life insurance and fun time...gotta enjoy life too.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Financial Hope","107xx","NY","21.76","0.0","5/1/1991","3.0","69.0","","17.0","0.0",24127,"70.5","47.0","f","0.0","",1

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.","home_improvement","Loan Needed for Home Improvement","922xx","CA","17.08","0.0","2/1/1992","3.0","0.0","0.0","23.0","0.0",108397,"67.3","53.0","f","0.0","",1

Just a year ago I got out of my first tour flying squadron and now I am here on shore duty, getting a house set up, and enjoying my time.  My brand new wife and I are spending our time getting our financial future set up and combined together.  Recently we have been looking into P2P as a neat way to invest, this loan would be to get started doing just that.     We have been living together for over a year and have quite an extensive income, but since we have combined our debt and I can only count my income, my DTI looks high.  With her income paying all her portion of the college bills, her car, her credit she has brought to the table, my DTI is 18% and this can be documented if you require details.  My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.  I earn approximately $10500 a month and my wife brings home another $3300 so you don't have any concerns about getting your money back if someone defaults on me.   Good Bidding!

I would like to consolidate these debts to get a lower interest rate, and pay down the debts faster.  I have excellent credit, and would be happy to answer any investors questions if you need further details.<br/> Borrower added on 01/11/11 > Personal Plea!<br/><br/>First THANK YOU to everyone who has invested so far! I appreciate your support. Second, I would like to take a few moments to appeal to any would-be investors.  <br/><br/>This is the most I have ever been in debt, and I am trying frantically to climb out as fast as I can.  Like I said, I have incurred several 1 time expenses that had to be put on my credit card including medical expenses, car repairs, and thanks to a mix-up by my former employer, some back taxes.  I am applying for this loan to get a lower interest rate.<br/><br/>I have an excellent payment history. I also have excellent job security. I am a postdoctoral fellow, currently doing neurobiology research.  Currently I have a 3-year contract, with an option to renew after that. In addition, I am a licensed pharmacist, so if anything were to happen, I could always pick up a pharmacy job, so my income is very very secure at this time. During my time as a graduate student, I received a small but decent stipend.  Despite all the debt I incurred, I was still able to pay off my car, and pay off some undergraduate loans during my graduate school career.  At this time, I am still making all my payments on time, and making progress on paying down my debt. This loan is very vital, as it will allow me to pay down my debt faster, and will allow me to get away from high credit card interest rates.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for taking time to consider financing my loan. After my debt is paid off, I can start to think about planning a wedding (it is out of the question now, I want to pay my debt off first) and start a family.

This loan would certainly guarantee that I become a 1st time home buyer this year.<br/> Borrower added on 08/24/10 > I believe that lenders should commit their funds to my loan because I am a low risk borrower. Being a tenured teacher I have a steady and safe job with a good salary.                <br/> <br/>I intend to pay the loan off in 2-3 years, possibly sooner. Luckily in CA as a 1st time home buyer I still have an opportunity to apply for the $10,000 tax credit that they extended until the end of this year. My intentions are to use the majority of the tax credit to pay off my loan. I do understand that there is a possibility that for some reason I may not receive the tax credit in full and that is why I mentioned 2-3 years to pay it off. I have a good credit score and good rapport with all of my creditors. I always pay within my terms and more often then not pay my balances off prior to the due dates. For example I just recently paid off my car approx 6 months ahead of schedule.<br/> Borrower added on 08/25/10 > My fiance and I have been pre-approved for a home mortgage loan of up to 325k, but given that this is our 1st home we are shopping in the market of 225k and below which would keep us well under our budget and not be overwhelming. I am the co-borrower on the mortgage loan and my fiance is the primary borrower. Even with this newly aquired debt of the personal loan our income to debt ratio will not be drastically affected. Our current combined annual income exceeds 100k and our debt to income ratio w/o our current rent and with this new loan payment is at approx 16%. Our debt to income ratio with our current rent payment of $950.00 and this new loan payment is approx 24%. The ideal debt to income ratio that mortgage lenders and investors would like to see is at 36% and we are well below that with our combined income and debts. This loan combined with some of our savings would help cover our 3.5% down payment on our 30 Year Fixed FHA loan as well as the closing and moving cost. I hope that this answers all of your questions and helps you instill the confidence in us to contribute to our loan. Again thanks for the consideration and should you have any additional questions please feel free to ask.

I took one out last year through Lending Club, which went very well. I have always made the payments on time and kept up other debt in the meanwhile. I had hoped to have the current loan paid off within the next six months. Unfortunately, due to matters beyond my control and which I am not at liberty to disclose, I was forced to take on additional debt over the course of the last six months. Now that the matter has been resolved, I can continue to pay off the existing loan and also pay down the new debt accrued at a fairly aggressive rate; however, I would prefer to secure a new loan for a slightly larger amount and longer term. My goal is to pay off the loan in 3 years or preferably less. With that said, I am requesting a five-year loan with the idea the unexpected can happen so having a lower monthly amount due to begin with will allow me to keep money in savings for the unknown and not have to rely on credit cards. I will also try to pay more than is due each month in order to pay off the loan as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>Using this new loan I am committed to: paying off the existing Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months; pay off all outstanding credit card and personal loan debt, and leave myself with only this new monthly loan, a small auto loan, monthly rent and some associated bills, such as heating, etc.<br/><br/>I would be willing to agree to a loan of a lesser amount. However, for the sake of credit upkeep and repair, my aim is for the full amount in order to close out any other existing loans, and pay off all existing credit card debt.<br/> Borrower added on 09/14/11 > Note to potential investors: I currently have a Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months and always paid on time. That loan is $415/month approximately. The new loan would pay off that 3-year loan and all other debt. The new terms would be only $10 more per month for a 5-year loan. I hope this very small ($10) adjustment per month and my history of paying this and all debt 100% on time will help you in your investment decision.  I will pay off the new loan, if received, before the 5-year term. The extended timeframe is merely a safety net, which allows me to pay the minimum due from time to time, though I plan to pay more than due each month 90% of the time, if not always.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Debt Consildation Loan","488xx","MI","18.26","0.0","6/1/1994","1.0","48.0","","17.0","0.0",6060,"35.9","37.0","f","0.0","",1

Interest rates on credit cards range from 15-18%, bank line of credit 12%, Prosper loan 10% and vehicle loan 18%.  Just received a generous credit card line from U.S. Bank.   I would move the $4,500 in credit debt to that card which guarantees a 3% rate on balance transfers for 5 years.   I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.  And then because of the new zero balance on the bank line of credit the remainder of the vehicle loan could be transferred to that line of credit.  So the bottom line is I am transferring my credit card debt to a 3% rate, my current line of credit balance to an 8% rate and portions of my vehicle loan to 12% and 8% rates.

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance. Now many of the promotional APR offers have expired on those cards and the rates have gone way up.     1. Bank of America American Express - $8,272 @ 10%    2. Chase Visa - $2,550 @ 19%    3. Chase Mastercard - $6,300 @ 13%    4. Discover Card - $6,075 @ 15%    5. Citi Bank - $1,237 @ 19%    6.

My financial situation:  I have a full time job as a finacial consultant with a well funded company.    My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.  Also,  t he probability of additonal sites opening and  being funded by the existing  operations will increase the future returns and more than be worth the tax deductible interest for this loan that I am asking you to fund.  Thank you in advance for reading this and helping me with this project.     Monthly net income: $ 7,900  Monthly expenses:    Housing: $ 1.825   Insurance: $ 120   Car expenses: $600    Utilities: $ 55   Phone, cable, internet: $40    Food, entertainment: $ 200   Clothing, household expenses $250    Credit cards and other loans: $ 1000   Other expenses: $ 400  Excess income over expenses = $3,410 This will be more than enough to both pay the loan and leave some for savings and emergencies.

Thus, a portion of this loan will be used to pay down the credit cards and improve my RLU.  Once I receive the Patriot Express Loan this loan will then be repaid in full. 	 The next several repayment scenarios involve the VA.  One, the VA VocRehab program reimburses me for the majority of my investment and this loan is paid off; two, the VA gets around to processing a VA disability claim I have in the neighborhood of $30,000 and this loan is paid off; or, three, and coincidentally the day my wife looks forward to the most, the VA finally processes another claim I have that amounts to roughly $75,000 in back-benefits and this loan is paid off.    Lastly, a large department store chain has asked to receive samples of our product line.  A portion of this loan will go toward having the samples manufactured.  The revenues from sells of the products will allow the loan to be serviced if not repaid entirely.  Of all the scenarios, this one is my favorite. 	 Thank you for your interest and hopefully your support.  Regardless, we look forward to seeing you during Op: ROCK the HOUSE.  Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is a ‰ÛÏHomecoming Celebration‰Û for service members by a service member. It lasts all summer long and is performed in three major acts. 	Act 1: May 5, 2009‰ÛÓDrop date. The release of a unique compilation CD, that has notable artists performing songs written by disabled Army veteran, Jet West.   	OBJECTIVE: A theme song and ‰ÛÏcelebration soundtrack‰Û to provide a means of national identity, espirit de corps, and party music for a nation-wide celebration in honor of returning American troops.  	Act 2: May 23-25, Memorial Day Weekend‰ÛÓShort Shots Leg 2, Short Shots, occurs as people across America shoot short video clips for the homecoming music video.  	OBJECTIVE: Embody the spirit of rebirth in the nation as it brings about new hope with new promise for all generations and celebrate the American military members who keep it possible.  	Act 3: September 4-7, Labor Day Weekend‰ÛÓTrooptastic Finale Three days of concerts held simultaneously in three cities with performers rotating between cities.   	Active military and veterans admitted free with government-issued picture ID‰ÛÓavailable free through the VA. Ticket prices set in inverse proportion to corporate sponsorship. Seeded with sales of the CD. 	OBJECTIVE: A national event to honor and celebrate the work of the military men and women who keep us free. 	Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is the brain child of disabled Army veteran and former Soldier of the Year, Jet West. Jet West Music Group Ltd is getting its start through the VA VocRehab program with financing made possible by LendingClub.com, the SBA Patriot Express Loan Initiative for veterans and, of course,  the thousands of contributors to Operation: ROCK the HOUSE. Jet West Music Group intends to use proceeds from these events to expand the entertainment options of service members stationed around the world far into the future starting with shows for the service members who missed Operation: ROCK the HOUSE.

Just in December of 2009, the sales revenue exceeded $250,000.<br/>The company consists of my partner and me along with warehouse workers, where I manage wholesale side and he takes care of our retail operations. The overhead is very low because we do our retail sales online so the only significant overhead is for our warehouse in NJ ($~1000/mo).<br/>We have been doing very well lately and need funds to continue doing business while our customers are making their scheduled payments (we have very good relationships with our clients and not a single payment has been missed yet). Some of our better customers get NET10 payment terms (we charge a higher price in that case), causing us to fall short on operating capital during that time frame.<br/>Personally, I have good credit history and yet to miss a payment on any accounts.

I have never missed a payment on any debt and I have never been late making a payment so I consider myself no risk to lenders. I have a good-excellent borderline credit score.

This is the perfect business investment loan to invest in for many reasons:<br/>1.  Managing a DVD Now Kiosk does not require me to quit my full-time job.<br/>2. DVD Kiosks are growing faster than any other vending opportunity in the market today.<br/>3. DVD Now competes with Red Box by offering Blue Ray and video games, which Red Box does not offer. Also Red Box only works with large chains like Wal-Mart.  My plan is to put Kiosks on college campuses, which Red Box doesn't touch.<br/>4. DVD Kiosks are set to explode.  Brick and mortar stores are closing and are being replaced by Kiosks which are much cheaper to run, yet can still bring in almost as much revenue.<br/>5. Investing in DVD Kiosks now is like investing in ATM machines in the early 80s, we are now in the ground floor stage.<br/>6. I have a degree in business, and over 7 years of sales, route sales, and inventory management experience.  All of which will help me with this endeavor.<br/>7.  Red Box kiosks have 3 revenue streams, as opposed to Red Box's one: rentals.  With a Red Box Kiosk, every time a customer rents a DVD, Blue Ray Disk, or Video Game, they are presented with the option to purchase.  Also DVD Now provides advertising space on their kiosks, which provides the kiosk owner with a steady monthly stream of income.<br/>","small_business","DVD Now Kiosk","244xx","VA","9.26","0.0","12/1/2002","0.0","30.0","","5.0","0.0",27265,"64.5","10.0","f","0.0","",1

I have done this a couple of times already with terrific success.  Over the past several years, I have turned my financial life around penny by penny. I went from having a very low FICO, twice as much debt and several derogatory credit marks due to an isolated personal hardship, to cleaning up everything through perseverance, sacrifice and hard work. I am incredibly proud of myself and confident in my ability to become debt free in just a few more years!  My partner is self-employed and work is slow right now. We are not in trouble yet, but I want to be proactive about ""tightening up the ship"" and not spending money where I don't have to. That includes high interest rates on debt.

During the move process, I ended up taking a loss on my home in Georgia to make the move.  As a result, a lot of my moving costs were funded by my credit cards.  In addition, I needed to come to the closing table with funds to be able to close.  I have been lucky in that I bought a townhome in MA in late February of 2009.  I am still carrying the debt on several cards and would like to consolidate and just have one loan to repay.  My intent is to then close most cards and keep one for emergencies.

0,"here! Networks","5 years","RENT","53307.0","not verified","n","Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.     If you have any questions or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.  I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with yoy.","debt_consolidation","Personal Loan to Consolidate Debt","921xx","CA","10.14","1.0","7/1/1995","1.0","22.0","","9.0","0.0",3608,"37.6","20.0","f","0.0","",1

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>","debt_consolidation","DebtCon","980xx","WA","9.84","1.0","2/1/1987","0.0","11.0","","9.0","0.0",35061,"94.2","30.0","f","0.0","",1

Unfortunately, my ‰ÛÏD‰Û credit rating is a result of difficulties  during those years of  the divorce & relocation.  I have made steady fiscal progress with each passing year.  My last big hurtle to reaching my goal of financial freedom is eliminating lingering bad debt.  No longer do I utilize credit cards to live!  When I moved to my current state of residence I accepted a state government job for $9.00/hr and no benefits in hopes of ‰Û÷making something happen‰Ûª with my life.

I am now one of the ‰Û÷go to gals‰Ûª for others in my professional community because of my integrity and experience in our field.  Presently I am paying a mortgage and assisting my husband with our mutual debt and repayment of  my old closed accounts which we took out a loan for 2 years ago. This loan is scheduled to be paid off by April 2009. Each month we sit down and pay the bills and we see no progress, other than just keeping current.  We would like to be able to one day help others in need and to do that we need to clear this debt up.  By combining these payments into one, perhaps a bit lower and certainly a lower interest rate, payment we could realize this dream.

0,"Cain Brothers & Co., LLC","1 year","MORTGAGE","95000.0","not verified","n","Help me take the last steps out of financial hardship, and into becoming a lender.  Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location ‰ÛÒ walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan ‰ÛÒ I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value ‰ÛÒ I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

When we first started planning, we decided that we wanted to wake up the day after our wedding having paid for it entirely, without any debt.  After analyzing our finances, we realized we needed a little help to reach our goal.  Our parents graciously volunteered to contribute $10,000 to our wedding.  However, as a result of the recent tumble of the stock market and housing markets, our parents are no longer able to help us pay for our wedding.    We don't want to cancel the wedding, as we've already paid $3,000 in deposits, and have friends and family who have already purchased plane tickets.  We decided instead to cut the guest list and trim back the menu, cut out luxuries like an open bar and fancy flower arrangements, and have reneogitated our contract with the venue and caterer.  As a result, we have managed to scale back our budget by 25%.    There are still some things that we really do not want to cut out, such as paying my grandmother's hotel and airfare so she can attend, as she wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise, and helping our parents with their plane tickets.    We plan to allocate $4,500 to actual expenses, and reserve $1,500 for emergencies.  Any cash we do not use will be paid back immediately.  We both have good, steady jobs, and would be able to pay back all principle and interest due in 3 years or less.    A loan to help us our with our special day would be greatly appreciated!

But please answer these two questions first please:<br/><br/><br/>1. Do you hold the title to your home on *your own name*<br/><br/><br/>2. How much equity do you have on your house? (please provide the home valuation and total balance of the mortgage/heloc loans)<br/><br/>Member_595101, Thank you for your question and possible financing.  To answer your questions, my home loan is in my husband and my name and is currently $127,299 with $747,00 of the $1,585 going to the principle.  We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.  I have set aside $900.00 in my bank account provided which is sperate from the family budget in order to pay the monthly payments.  Sorry for the delay in answering your question.  Have a nice day.<br/> Borrower added on 06/03/10 > In the notes section, lending club suggests to offer information regarding on how I will pay back this loan, stable employment, what makes me a good borrower, and monthly budget.<br/><br/>Stable Employment:  I started working at 15 Ìâå_ and have only been unemployed once in my life.  I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.  At that time it was good news since a severance package afforded me to stay home with my new baby, as well a return to college for a Microsoft Certification Program. I received my MCSE certification and began working for an IT Company where I worked for 9 Ìâå_ years.  During the 9 Ìâå_ years I moved up the chain and eventually transferred to an account that supported the City.  I was promoted to Network/Server Manager but transferred to my current position when there was an opening.  So realistically, I have been at this current location for over 11 years.  Five years doesnÌ¢åÛåªt sound very creditable.<br/> <br/>Good Borrower:  For years I had a credit rating of over 820-840s, and want it back.  I allowed myself to be unselfish and naive to loan funds that were never repaid.  I just want this debt paid off and plan to look into helping others through this type of funding.  What a great opportunity.<br/><br/>Monthly Budget:  I have set aside $450.00 bi-monthly which will cover this payment.  <br/><br/>How will I use this loan:  It will be used to consolidate my credit cards and I will be able to pay a lower interest rate, which can be paid off in 3 years.<br/><br/>Thank you!!<br/>","debt_consolidation","Consolidate SZ8J4F","917xx","CA","11.72","3.0","8/1/1986","0.0","3.0","","15.0","0.0",32169,"60.9","24.0","f","0.0","",1

I would put about a $10K balance on it from time to time while taking advantage of 0% CC loans. I was making some money using the big Credit Card companies system against them.  My bank decided to ""re-value"" my house and my HELOC got chopped to $1K max value. Then I though ""I don't want to become a statistic if something ever happens with my job."" My job has been steady for 5 years and looks like it will be for another 5, but you never know.  My wife and I decided to start living in our basement and renting out the top of the house as a Vacation Rental and sometimes as a Bed & Breakfast. So we did some remodeling and racked up our first permanent CC debt in my life ($10 K). We have started renting our house and things look promising.  I hate the idea of giving the interest I made off of the CC companies back to them and would rather get a loan from investors here.","small_business","Startup Vacation Rental Buis","981xx","WA","5.68","0.0","2/1/1994","2.0","","","10.0","0.0",37964,"57.4","31.0","f","0.0","",1

We just closed a deal to have all of our books distributed in all major bookstores in the US and in the UK starting September 2008. In addition, we will be featured on a nationally syndicated radio program that reaches 3.8 million listeners a week. We will use this platform to launch our merchandising line that features characters from our line of books for the upcoming Christmas season.   The $6,000 dollars will be used to purchase the necessary advertising slots and inventory needed to launch this product line.

I will continue to do so in an effort to pay ahead of my target schedule of 18 months.<br/>I am in excellent standing with my new employer and I am amoung the top performers they have in the field.  I am a dedicated, hard working employee and have been recognized as such by Corix management and IBEW Union.

I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.

I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk.

I'm very pleased to see an opportunity like this where people can help other people and make a safe investment as well. I'm so sick of the banks and financial industry having all the power. That's why ""Damn the Man"".  The short story is after dealing with a computer error on my Home Depot payment,  (Citi Bank) which they owned up to and admitted there were some glitches, my payment posted late by less than 24 hours. They so conveniently raised my rate to the default of 29.99%. When I inquired and tried to get my rate reset, they said they have no control or ability to do that.  I've never had such a bad experience with any other company or my other Citi accounts.  I only need 2666.00 to pay off the Depot account, it's already been closed, I'm done with them. The balance will be used to consolidate 1 other card that is at 17%, about another $1750.00.  The remaining be paid back to lending club early, at this point I have no need for it, my remaining credit accounts are all at reasonable rates. FYI, the credit score listed is incorrect, I have CreditSecure with American Express and my combined Fico score as December 1st was 703, down from 730 over the last year  because my balances on a couple cards increased for business use and has not been paid down yet.

0,"Tighe Patton Armstrong Teasdale","8 years","MORTGAGE","131000.0","not verified","n","I have been offered a partnership in my downtown Washington, D.C. law firm, but there is a hitch.  My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.","small_business","Partnership Bridge Loan","220xx","VA","15.16","0.0","5/1/1987","0.0","33.0","","8.0","0.0",134025,"67.9","16.0","f","0.0","",1

I obtained a BA in Information Systems and recently obtained a good paying job.  Other than hanging with my family I enjoy racing motocross with my son and working out.  Credit situation: Back in 2000 I filed for Chap. 7 Bankruptcy because I was young and not aware of how credit worked back then.  Since then I have been very responsible and have been  rebuilding my credit.  I have never been late on any payments.  Purpose of loan: The purpose of this loan will be to consolidate  2 outstanding loans that have interest rates of 25% and one credit card with a balance of $600.  Budget: I will be repaying this loan back with my paychecks each month.  Currently I bring home around $5200 per month.  My monthly expenses are around $4400, so paying this back will not be a problem.  I just want to lower my interest rate on my loan. Please see below for budget layout.  Monthly net income: $ 5100  Monthly expenses: $ 4355   Housing: $ 1100  Insurance: $ 105   Car expenses: $ 650   Utilities: $ 200   Phone, cable, internet: $ 120  Food, entertainment: $ 900   Credit cards and other loans: $ 930   Other expenses: $ 350  Closing: If you invest in me I can guarantee that I will be a good investment, as I said I am a very responsible family man that always pays his bills.

My responsibilities continue to grow as I bring in new accounts and expand our offerings. My fiance secured a job in management at a sporting goods store with a national retail company in February, and is eager to make a name for himself here. We are both hardworkers and come from similar backgrounds that stress that. <br/><br/>I bought my condo 3 1/2 years ago - and the housing market as taken a hit. We plan to live here for at least two to three more years to be able to be in a better position with the mortgage. Due to the market drop, a home equity loan is not an option.<br/><br/>We feel we are a good borrower because we have recognized the mistakes we made, and are not happy that we put ourselves in this position. We have been trying for the past few months to get a handle on our debt, but feel we can best do this with a personal loan that can help us better manage our payments, and eventually put us in a position to start saving. Not that we were not before, but are now moreso very careful with our money.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to help us pay off a good number of our credit cards, as well as pay the remaining balance due on our wedding. If we knew now what we knew last summer, maybe we would have approached our wedding differently. But hindsight is 20-20, so now we are just trying to get our finances on the right track. <br/><br/>We know that the monthly payment we take on, if our loan is fully funded, will represent 12% of our monthly income -- and this would help put us in a much better position that we stand right now.<br/> Borrower added on 07/29/10 > We appreciate the investments to date.

I recently purchased a new personal residence that I used most of my free cash to acquire.  I came across a great real estate deal that I want to complete.  In the past, hard money lenders would simply lend on investment properties based on the loan to value but now the hard money lenders want you to put up a down payment as well.  That brings me to Lending Club.  The terms through Lending Club allow me to still meet my investment parameters so I figured I would give it a try.  The loan will be used as the downpayment for an investment property that I am going to repair and resell.  The property is in the Petworth area of Washington, DC.  The purchase price is $160,000 and the repairs are estimated at $55,000 with a $5,000 contingency ($60,000 total repair estimate) for a total of $220,000 (62% of value) to acquire and fix up the property.  The after repair value of the property is $355,000 which is conversative.  My hard money lender looked at the deal and immediately said it was solid.  The hard money is lined up but the lender requires that I have some ""skin in the game"" in this environment so he wants me to put down $20,000 as a downpayment.  I am able to pay $5,000 and I am looking for a loan to pay the rest.  I look forward to us all making some money!","house","RE Investment Property at 62% of Value","200xx","DC","3.08","0.0","2/1/1997","7.0","","","7.0","0.0",2149,"17.5","15.0","f","0.0","",1

I have always had decent credit but got into some trouble with credit cards due to having to travel and problems with a car. The only negatives I have on my account are a high credit limit on 2 cards. IÌ¢åÛåªve never been late on anything. <br/><br/>ItÌ¢åÛåªs hard to get ahead when each card is killing you on interest. Every time I would pay a credit card down they would lower my credit limit so it reflects bad on my credit and shows my balance is close to my limit. With having to put down a good amount on buying a home its left me with no cash to put into my landscaping. I want to get started with sprinklers and grass for now.

I always seem to fall just short of breaking even and I am hoping that someone who has fallen on hard times before is willing to put a little faith into me. I am also currently maintaining my parents old home while they are relocated to help a family member in need.  Every penny that I would have had has gone into this place and, now that it is time for me get back to my own surroundings, I have nothing to do so. With $6,000, I would like to do the following:  *Pay off my three credit cards (debts totalling 3,500).  *Help my parents paint this house so that it can be put up for sale and they can put their time and energy into their own personal issues.  I am not looking to get rich OR borrow more than I need.  I am also not interested in living beyond my means...I have definately learned THAT lesson the hard way.

That said, I think itÌ¢åÛåªs only fair I give a little background of whom I am and why IÌ¢åÛåªm making my request.  IÌ¢åÛåªm a government employee with The Unified Court System which is comprised of all the courts in New York State plus the Office of Court Administration.  I have worked for the Office of Court Administration for over 21 years.  I started my career as a court officer and rose up the ranks to my present position as Deputy Chief Clerk.  In todayÌ¢åÛåªs precarious working environment I can ensure you I have very secure employment and rewarding income.  I have two children in college.  I elected to pay a good portion of their college expenses with my credit cards.  Hindsight suggests a different approach. As the end draws near, I would like to have all of my credit cardÌ¢åÛåªs expenses paid off within four years.   IÌ¢åÛåªm very comfortable with the payments offered by LendingClub.  The interest rate is similar to the combined average of the cards I would like to payoff, but having automated payments and a three year payoff is satisfying.   I want to thank everyone in advance for helping me reach one of my goals.  IÌ¢åÛåªm deeply grateful and humbled you made the decision to invest in me.","debt_consolidation","3 year plan","103xx","NY","13.88","1.0","5/1/1990","0.0","22.0","","20.0","0.0",54459,"71.9","50.0","f","0.0","",1

The total consolidated is $19,631.65 with interest rates between 18.99-23%. By consolidating them I looking to get a lower rate and one manageable payment to pay them off quicker. My monthly expenses are as follows: Rent: $900.00; Car Insurance for myself and my two daughters is: $163.77; I have no car payment; my utilities average between 120.00-232.00, depending on the time of year. I have no home phone, just a cell which is $120.00; my food averages at about $300.00 a month; I have a student loan for $397.21. I am a single mother with two girls who are college age and attend college. I have never defaulted on a loan. I have always made my payments and have strong sense of responsiblity in fulfilling and any and all obligations I am responsible for. The last year and half has been an extremely tough for my family and I. As is with a lot of people I realize. My oldest daughter had some personal issues that as a mother I could not turn her away, so I helped her. In  helping her I aquired debt on my credit cards. Additionally there were medical problems that my insurance company did not cover or they only paid a certain percentage. I was forced to put the balances on my cards. It has been a very difficult time, but I am deteremined to make it through. I appreciate any help that can be given. I have always honored my debts and have always strived to do the best with what I have been given. I have never, nor do I ever intend to file bankruptcy. I will do what is necessary and work as hard as is necessary to fulfill my obligations. Thank you for any consideration you give me.

My start date was not considered until after the probationary period new hires go through. I apologize for the inaccurate information I provided previously.<br/> Borrower added on 03/15/10 > I have had several investors today ask the particulars regarding the remaining revolving credit not combined in this loan request. I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked. If not, please feel free to ask any other questions you may have as a prospective lender.

0,"Oracle","4 years","MORTGAGE","102000.0","VERIFIED - income","n","  Borrower added on 07/05/10 > Hello!  Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Axing the APR","941xx","CA","16.8","0.0","12/1/1990","0.0","","","9.0","0.0",49692,"89.3","22.0","f","0.0","",1

There is a well and electricity on the property, thankfully.  However, we still need to put lines in to hook them up to the house, and we need to put in a septic system.  We also need to modify the eaves on the house to comply with local fire codes.   My husband has done a lot of the work himself to save money on labor.

1,"Eternally Healthy LLC","3 years","RENT","108901.0","VERIFIED - income","n","Hello! We're a happily married couple (17 years) with children, and we're seeking a loan to eliminate our credit card debt. For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.   Thank you!","debt_consolidation","Loan To Eliminate Credit Card Debt","335xx","FL","13.43","0.0","12/1/1991","0.0","","89.0","6.0","1.0",30497,"93.8","14.0","f","0.0","",1

I moved into hers, and mine went on the market.  It's finally under contract, but because its value has declined, I'm losing approximately $12,500 on the loan.<br/><br/>So the purpose of this loan is to cover the gap after the sale of the house.  I'm a firm believer that if you take out a loan, you pay it back; hence the reason I'm not considering a ""short sale"" or principal forgiveness from the lenders; I bought the house initially, so I have to pay for my loss, now!<br/><br/>The house under contract, and I'm expecting closing in the next 2-3 weeks.  The buyer was prequalified, and we're not expecting any issues; all we have to do is wait til closing.<br/><br/>My wife and my finances are seperate, so after the house sells (approximately $775/mo mortgage), then I will easily be able to afford this gap loan.  I am currently paying off all of my other debts at an advanced rate (way above the minimum payments), and plan on sending the full $775/mo I'm currently spending on mortgage payment to repay this loan quickly.  <br/><br/>I've been to my bank, and unfortunately they are not offering personal loans at this time (darn you, Chase!!), so without the help of Lending Club, I'm going to be stuck with a house I don't live in, and will have to cancel the sale (at a cost to the realtors, I'm sure)!!

I did not have fix rate credit cards, and with today's economy, many of them increased my interest rate by as much as 13%.  Also, as far as being responsible, I keep to a tight budget, and use Quicken to track my expenses so I can work out averages and budget my expenses.  I do not spend more than I can afford to pay, and when I do have to apply for loans it usually is only for a better &quot;financial strategy&quot; to obtain a lower interest rate.  For instance, last year I refinanced my home as I could lower my interest rate by 2.5%.  .<br/>","other","Other Loan","025xx","MA","8.02","0.0","10/1/1988","0.0","","","11.0","0.0",12434,"55.6","27.0","f","0.0","",1

This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.  The motor was under water for about an hour, and though we were able to get it running again, it wasn't completely saved. It appears something got tweaked inside when it got wet while running. This is a large center console fishing boat that is in demand on a daily basis.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I plan to use the money to continue to grow my small business.  I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.  I purchased this business last year, investing a good portion of my life savings as well as some home equity into it.  I have grown the revenue roughly 40% over the previous ownership, and I have become a one-stop-shop for everything fun related in conjunction with watersports.  In 10 months we have added 2 more boats and 2 waverunners, 4 kayaks, 3 surfboards, a banana boat, boogie boards, as well as other revenue generating equipment to the fleet.  I have developed working relationships with Hilton, Marriott, and various other resort companies here in South Florida, and I plan to begin an online reservation system and Franchise plan in the near future.  This extra capital will allow me to stretch a vital purchase out over time in order to not hinder further growth and progress of my small business.

It will be updated with glass tile for shower and surrounds and ceramic on the floor. The sink will be replaced with a floating vanity and custom-size mirror with vanity lighting. <br/><br/>The kitchen will see refaced cabinetry and replacement of laminate counter with polished/stained concrete counters.

I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, I‰Ûªve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The ‰ÛÏone man‰Û shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, ‰ÛÏall you can eat‰Û support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. It‰Ûªs also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a company‰Ûªs IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etc‰Û_) A typical ‰ÛÏcomputer‰Û company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business I‰Ûªve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. It‰Ûªs a tool to help get the next level.  3.	Personal Growth: I have had to change my personal mentality from being a computer tech to an entrepreneur who manages a growing company.  I appreciate your time and please feel free to contact me for questions.  Thanks for your consideration.

I volunteer my time with my local fire department as a firefighter/EMT, and I have been with the dept since Jan. of 06. I need this loan as the downpayment on a 4.43 acre tract of land.  I have been looking at purchasing this land for over 2 years, and have had difficulty being able to come up with the funding. Due to the economy banks now require a downpayment or collateral of other real estate when purchasing land. I have been unable to save a downpayment due to family emergencies and some vehicle repairs that were unavoidable. My 2004 year model vehicle is paid for, but banks will not accept a vehicle for collateral anymore. My family is unable to lend me any money to help with a downpayment, due to the fact that a year and half ago my grandmothers home was destroyed in a fire, and we are having to help her financially. I plan to purchase this land, pay it off, and then use it as collateral for the contruction of a home on the property. I hope that with your help, I will be able to secure this parcel of land and start my dream of having a home of my own. I elected to use a 5 year term so that I can have more flexibility in payments, but my plans are to have the loan repaid in 48 months, if not sooner than that.

I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.  Thank you for reading my story, and thank you for helping.<br/>","debt_consolidation","HELP!

The claim won't cover the gutters and downspout work nor one portion of the roof.

Since I am taking a loan I thought it made sense to roll two appx $1500 debts into this at the better rate. I recently finished paying off debt where I was paying appx $530/month. I've been steadily paying off debts and freeing up money. By rolling in two debts that I currently pay $150/month towards into this loan request, I only need $130 out of the $530 I've recently freed up to meet this loan commitment.<br/> <br/>First and foremost, this loan helps me fix my house, it's a job that has to be done one way or the other, 6000 goes to that. Then, I further help my financial position by consolidating two higher interest debts into this loan.<br/><br/>Keeping finances healthy is of paramount importance. I have a family and feel it's critical that I maintain my credit and take care of my obligations, I have healthy cash flow to do this. I am at a stage in my life where stability is very important.

I get that.  However, the two separate incidents had more to do with administrative blunders, ie failing to set up the auto payment correctly before leaving the country for 6 weeks (for work) than they do about my unwillingness or inability to pay.  I learned VERY quickly from this and have maintained exemplary credit ever since.  And, I refer you back to my current employment status as evidence that this is the case.  <br/><br/>I appreciate any assistance this forum can provide and I'm grateful to your willingness to take the risk and help out.  I can only assure you, for whatever assurance you get online, that I am responsible, upstanding and have NO intention of defaulting on any loan, ever.<br/>","moving","DC State move","200xx","DC","4.33","2.0","8/1/2001","1.0","15.0","","4.0","0.0",0,"0.0","18.0","f","0.0","",1

I would use a portion of the loan to fund my existing rental property. The other investment is in a health and nutrition company that would yield immediate profit from selling products.  My parent have an auto laon that is under my name. This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.   I am an excellent candidate because I have great credit history and payment for the last 7 years when I first established credit. My fico score is 736 on Equifax. My cost of living is going to change dramatically. I will be moving back with my family to once again help them out. But I am looking forward to it since it would reduce my expenses by $700-$800 monthly. This would afford me the opportunity to get the wheels of the financial fortune turning.

In those two years, I had a few jobs which didn't pay particularly well and a few months of unemployment.  I relied too heavily on credit cards to fill the gaps when my job wasn't enough.  Before I knew it, I was buried in credit card debt and the rates on the majority of the debt had more than doubled.  I have since found a secure job in my field of study (which I have been at for almost two years now) and have learned to budget and stop using/relying on credit cards.  However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.  I'm still young but I'm starting to think of my financial future and I'm confident this is the first step.

I  have taken out some loans to help my mother and ease some of her financial burden.
